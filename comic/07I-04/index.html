<p>With this… I want to finally celebrate the first anniversary of this comic! While technically the first page was done on September 19th and some of the characters had been created long before, it was a sketch the one that kickstarted the whole comic idea and that one was made on September 17th, 2022.</p>

<p>Last year I was working but I had lost most of my love for art due to multiple reasons. I decided to start this comic because “If I don’t do it now i will never do it”. And it ended becoming a sort of miracle cure: Working on this brought me back all the love I had for arting. And while properly getting back into the groove was extremely hard (couple with a lot of RL reasons), this comic helped me to regain my sanity and the appreciation for everything.</p>

<p>I decided to pour here everything I had learned so far. Writing. Trying to make a story that didnt rely on crude jokes, edgy stories just for the sake of being edgy, and trying to keep it SFW to an extent.</p>

<p>Chapter 1 didn’t have much writing on it beforehand (just a vague note); I was trying to just “draw, don’t stop”. I was also afraid of losing interest (like has happened with most of my stuff before) so I wasn’t sure how far I was going to reach with this (and that’s why I didn’t try to make a page like this for the comic at first). But I carried on. And started properly writing the story I wanted. I look at it now and its insane for me to think that I have an actual proper story, a lot of characters and relationships that feel natural.</p>

<p>This story is what I think is my magnum opus and I’m putting all I know, learned and have into it. However, saying I’ve done this alone would be super false. I tried to put in the credits the peeps who have helped me in one way or another, and I want to sincerely thank not only them, but also you, the reader, for your interest and for reading this, and also to everyone who shares this and so. I hope to continue making a story you like.</p>

<p>See you during November or December when chapter 8 comes!</p>

                        <p>Panel 1: D is in a graveyard. He says “…And that’s what’s been going on. I even got a space sister, one that actually acts way less spoiled than your daughter in spite of having much more”.</p>

<p>Panel 2: D smells a handful of flowers with their eyes closed.</p>

<p>Panel 3: D drops the flowers next to the gravestone of ‘Emma Reh’ with an epitaph in German: 'Der Tod, so bitter er auch sein mag, ist nicht das Ende, sondern nur eine weitere Stufe, von der aus wir zu einem besseren Leben übergehen’. D says “You know what, old hag? I forgive you for all the bullshit. To be honest, I’m sorry you never found happiness in your life; unlike what you taught me, I learned that life actually can be beautiful and worth living. I don’t really love you, but I genuinely hope you found some peace at the end, and that you’re having fun with all your boys down there. Now it’s my time… to leave with my new family, or pack, as we call ourselves. And you… You sleep well or whatever. Auf Wiedersehen wir sehen uns in der holle”.</p>

<p>Panel 4: The band is walking through a street, but both Sher and Rowi are hugging D. Rowi says “Hey D, you’re still very stressed. Wanna get some Döner Kebab with us?”. D replies “S…sure! Thank you guys. You’re the best thing that has happened to me in my life”.</p>

<p>Panel 5: Roi, standing on a ceiling, wearing a visor, says “We love you too, D. You can be sure of that”. There’s a small narration square saying “End of recap. Thank you for reading this intermission. The story will resume in Chapter 8”.</p>
