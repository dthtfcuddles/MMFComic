<h1>Politics</h1>

<p>Russet: We wanted to make it clear here that Rowi had overstepped the mark here. The Illuminate COULD have walked away from it and left Sawi's pack responsible for what her brother just did.<br />
This would have bankrupted the Ouakkia pack pretty badly. They'd have found themselves cut off and bounced out the bottom of the pack Hierarchy or cut off as an Independent pack.<br />
So the fact Ck'akk wants to find a way to make it work is a good sign.</p>

<p>htf: Rowi needs to get a well deserved noogie for what he did. It was a literal gamble. And while it could feel a bit out of character, in reality it isn't; in my mind he was just trying to see for the bunny side of his extended family. Sawi is completely justified in being annoyed though.</p>

                        <p>Panel 1 shows Ck'akk and her aide entering a room. Ck'akk says "wait, he just left? Like, for real and peacefully? This is certainly super anticlimatic". The aide replies "Yup. Everyone, even Sher himself were shocked that it worked, but as our law department told me, this puts us in a pickle, because what Rowi offered is beyond his legal capabilities, and if the Horker King learns about this, he will use it against us".</p>

<p>Panel 2 shows Sawi talking on a video call. "Yep, everything you were told is 100% accurate. I also apologize for my brother promising stuff on behalf of the Illuminate. He overestimated his and our position. Is there anything we could do to make this right?".</p>

<p>Ck'akk asks another avali "Sister?". This other Avali says "Technically speaking, the agreement is between the Ouakkia pack and the bunny diplomat, so in theory we can't do anything. However...</p>

<p>Panel 4: "There is a solution to all this, but it's something we have to discuss as a pack. So, take the next 3 days to rest. After that we'll contact you to set up the next steps". Sawi says "Okay. Sawi out" and cuts the communication.</p>

<p>Panel 5: Finally, Ck'akk asks "What's up sis? What is it you need us to discuss as a pack?". The other avali replies "Okay sis. Before saying anything, I'll ask you. Why are we doing this? Technically is just an alien species. Normally we wouldn't even care. At most we'd tell our ministry of foreign affairs to take care of this".</p>
