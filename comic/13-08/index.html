<p>Oh no, lots of text again<br />
Unfortunately thats a given when legal matters are involved.</p>

<p>Russet: Rowi got in so much trouble for this! Everyone in his pack gave him a hard time for going well over-board and not giving anyone any warning.<br />
He did after all nearly ruin them as a family!<br />
But hey Diplomacy!!</p>

<p>htf: I dont know if he would've ruined them as a family, but it was certainly a very stressful gamble and he <i>really</i> should've told at least Sawi of his plan. Unless what Rowi did was something he thought in that exact moment and went for it without thinking twice. And... I have no idea if that would've made it better or worse.</p>

                        <p>Panel 1 shows Sawi in a double video call, with the Illuminate lawyer in one window, Rowi and Sher in another. The lawyer says "While the agreement is between the Ouakkia Pack and the Bunny Species, we are open to buying the agreement. This means the Illuminate will get the earnings and the responsibilities included in it. You all have the document to read".</p>

<p>Panel 2 shows Sawi reading on her tablet. "I'm looking at it now, according to this the Illuminate will get sale rights to the natural resources in return for uplifting the bunnies, but will also give an 11% share of those earnings to the Vampire Bunny species for an initial period of 50 years, with negotiations to open at this point to readjust the ratios. ... Yeah, the more i read this I think this is fine. 11% is very generous, in contracts of this kind you usually get 6 to 9 percent. We'll read this together once the call is over, Cherry".</p>

<p>Panel 3 shows a spaceship soaring away from the planet. The narration says "After reading the document carefully, Sher decided to sign it and accept the offer from the Illuminate. It was very favorable for the vampire bunnies, and while Sawi suspected that Ck'akk had other reasons for being this generous, it was an offer they couldn't refuse. They needed to sign the agreement, so Sher and Rowi traveled to Avalon. D, Roi and Mekari stayed on Babupekkakerok".</p>

<p>Panel 4 shows Sawi giving Rowi a noogie. "Okay, brother, this is for planning all this without telling me, or anyone beforehand! You gave me no time to prepare for anything!". Rowi says "ow" and Sher, with a shocked expression says "Nooo!".</p>

<p>Panel 5 shows Sher signing. The narration says "The ceremony happened without any issues. Sher and Sawi read the document again, together, multiple times before signing".</p>
