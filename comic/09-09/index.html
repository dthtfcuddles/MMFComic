<p>Russet: Turns out keeping a restaurant that is a front for a drug dealing operation in the Black and operating properly is hard. Don't blame Sher he's not tanking the business due to bad maths it just doesn't work as a normal restaurant.<br />
htf: I mean, even if it worked normally, it would be extremely difficult for someone who never had to do math in their life before.</p>

                        <p>Panel 1: “After that, I tried to keep the restaurant afloat, but since I had never been allowed to touch the money except to give it to Mr. Rodríguez, I failed hard at it. In only two days my brain was mush from trying to do calculations and trying to work out how income versus debt worked”. Sher says “Okay, this restaurant has a debt of CLP $2500K [USD $4630 in 2006] but there’s only $100K of earning [USD $185]… and… ugh… agh, I lost the train of thought”.</p>

<p>Panel 2: “I got a respite very shortly after: A cousin of Mr. Rodríguez came and said he’d take control of the place. I said ‘Yes, please’. He asked me what I had told the police. I said "nothing”. That was my first time ever saying a lie, and I felt wrong for weeks afterwards". A man asks “Are you Sher? The alien my cousin hired to work here?”. Sher says “Yes, I am, sir”.</p>

<p>Panel 3: “That guy paid me an actually really good amount of money for my silence, unaware the police knew about it already. I decided to try to rent an apartment. I didn’t have trouble; and while the landlord told me to mind my fur and hair, everything went smoothly. I went back to busking. I also bought a laptop, since Earthlings were starting to rely more and more on internet services”.</p>

<p>Panel 4: “One important thing to keep in mind is that Rowi and me had remained in contact. I had shared my instant messaging information with him when we met, and once he had settled in Argentina, he set up his own IM account, and we started talking. He moved to Germany a few months later and we continued talking, even if the different timezones made it a funky bussiness”. Rowi says “Oh yeah, our first MSN talks. They were fun &lt;3”.</p>
