<!-- Anything in brackets that start with an exclamation mark, like this, is called a comment! It will not affect the HTML of your page. It's just a note from me to you! -->
<!-- There's a little extra HTML I've added here to jazz up the front page, but you don't need it! If you just want basic HTML with p tags and h1 tags and such, that will also work just fine. -->

<!-- The front page uses a responsive 2-column layout. This is done by first defining what content is going to be in the column layout, like so. -->
<div class="right-column-layout"></div>
<!-- For this page, I've used a layout where the right column is wider than the left. If you want the left column to be wider than the right, change the class to "left-column-layout"! -->

<!-- Next, we separate what we want into the left and right columns. -->
    <div class="left-column">
    </div>

    <div class="right-column">
    </div>
</div>
<!-- That's the end of the column layout! Everything below this is just normal HTML. -->

<!-- If you want to set some information apart, you can set the class as "infobox"! That will put your content in a different block of color, which can be defined in stylesheet.css. -->
