<p>“Approaching the edge of UR-87g-Alpha,” Ifelse’s voice rang out across the bridge even though the AI’s Jakub hologram was perched atop Taran’s head, “Translation to real space in three, two…”</p>
<p>The big view-screen across the front of the bridge swirled with a kaleidoscope of colours, Cri stared at it in awe. He couldn’t help it, every time he saw it he was enraptured, so many colours, some he had no names for; whirled across the screen as a visual representation of the warp drive shutting down. The darkness of space washed back, stars filled the outer edge of the big screen but toward the centre there was a ring of pure darkness with the soft pink shades of the local star shining in the middle.</p>
<p>“Confirmed, UR-87g-Alpha,” Taran said, the teal and orange Avali twisted around in his chair to look at Selenu, “We are about an hour sub-light travel from Homestead, Cultarvian Border Control are querying our identity.”</p>
<p>“Let them know who we are,” Selenu said, “Once we have approach clearance take us in at whatever speed they approve,” Selenu flicked her ears back, “Seinu I will leave initial greeting with the Negotiating team to you, I will go let Avalon know we have arrived.”</p>
<p>She stood up and looked around the bridge at the pack, “Taran, Ki prepare the Odyssey for an extended stay in orbit around the station.”</p>
<p>“We aren’t going to dock?” Taran asked, sounding surprised.</p>
<p>“No Seinu wants us to remain in orbit, something to do with looking independent?”</p>
<p>“We are here as an independent third party, if we dock at Homestead  it looks like we are part of the Cultarvian delegation, technically we are an Embassy of Avalon, remaining separate helps with that illusion.”</p>
<p>“More politics,” Taran sighed, “Got it, but ok we’ll prepare for a long stay in orbit.”</p>
<p>Selenu nodded and turned to Firi, “Firi liaise with Seinu on his plans and work out the best escort plan between yourself and the twins,” Cri perked up at that and glanced over at Firi. The yellow Avali nodded, frowning at Seinu.</p>
<p>“Yeah I will get on that, Seinu I mean this, no wandering off without one of us ok?”</p>
<p>“Yes I understand,” Seinu nodded, “Come on Chantelle we need to plan the right order to greet all the delegations involved in this mess.”</p>
<p>Selenu grabbed her brothers shoulder and turned the silver Avali to face her, “I am being serious,” she said, “If you wander off I will confine you to the Odyssey, you went down to the colony last week despite my orders not to leave the ship.”</p>
<p>“But…” Seinu started to protest but she clamped his muzzle shut with one paw.</p>
<p>“No buts, nothing happened at the colony, but my threat assessment was it was too dangerous for you to go, you ignored it. Do that again and I will tell Ck’akk and let her lecture you. If you think I am wrong, talk to me about it and we will reassess but don’t just ignore me.”</p>
<p>Seinu sighed and nodded, well aware that she was right. She nodded and let him go and Cri watched Seinu leave with his sister, Selenu vanished into the Captain’s bridge office and Taran and Ki had their heads together over a console discussing air supply. Cri however wandered over to Firi dragging Cal with him and chirped up at her curiously, she was still frowning about something and she smelled concerned.</p>
<p>“Is everything ok?”</p>
<p>“Hmm,” Firi turned to the bunnies and smiled, “Probably, I am just being paranoid. Homestead is a huge station, with thousands of people from all kinds of races on board, it’s the perfect place for something to go wrong or for an opportunist who dislikes the Illuminate to attack Seinu. He's a big target, especially since something seems wrong about these negotiations.”</p>
<p>“Wrong how?” Cri asked, Cal seemed absorbed in whatever game he was playing on his phone, but he flicked his eyes up, he was listening and Cri was genuinely curious, the alien cultures they had encountered outside the Avali and their behaviours were fascinating to him. Watching how the Avali interacted with their allies and contemporaries was so much fun to watch, he had been hoping to see a lot more interactions with different aliens at such a populous station, now it sounded like he would have to be on extra guard.</p>
<p>“I am not sure,” Firi frowned at the forward view-screen and the distant dot of light that was the station, “I know the Cultarvian, they are quiet, friendly and usually very good at brokering their own deals with others, it just feels weird that they have called Seinu in.”</p>
<p>Cal glanced up from his tablet, “I mean he is pretty awesome right? Who wouldn’t want him on their team?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Firi frowned, “But the S’grael are long time allies of the Avali, heck Chantelle went to University on one of their worlds, we have trading agreements with the Farndos and the Cultarvian but this seems weird, like why can’t these three reach an agreement without us.”</p>
<p>“We’ll keep a closer eye on things then,” Cri said with a smile, “We got this Firi.”</p>
<p>“I know you do boys,” she rested a hand atop their heads, “But be extra wary, that station is full of aliens, ones who don’t like the Avali, supposed friends, allies, I suspect them all at this point, Seinu isn’t saying anything but I know he’s puzzled too.”</p>
<p>“What’s the big deal though?” Cal asked, “Like he gets called to talks all the time I’ve read his mission logs, you guys fly around the Universe having talks, studying planets, visiting aliens to learn their cultures.”</p>
<p>“We do, and this is Seinu’s first really big job involving so many moving pieces since he started his new training course from Director Ck’akk so its important it goes well,” Firi said, “But it is very unusual to be called in halfway like this, you either call for an Avali Diplomat at the start of the talks or not at all, not half way like this.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see,” Cri tilted his head, “It sounds like intrigue to me.”</p>
<p>“Very much so,” Firi started for the door, motioning for the bunnies to follow her, “But until we know if this is point scoring or an actual plot we act as if we expect Seinu to be attacked, so come on let’s go come up with a plan.”</p>
<p>Cri nodded and dragged Cal along with him, following the yellow and white Avali, they would keep Seinu safe whether he knew he needed protection or not.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3I9Gf5e.png"></p>
<p>Sitting at his desk Seinu was reading over the notes and dossiers on the three ambassadors, the negotiations that had taken place so far, the sticking points and issues that had mired the talks in a snow-drift of delaying tactics, confusion and misunderstandings. Negotiator Dalant of the Cultarvian’s had sent a comprehensive document and it made Seinu’s head hurt. He glanced at Chantelle, his elegant blue and white sister sat in a chair opposite him, seemingly staring at nothing though he knew she’d be immersed in a virtual world of charts, data and news snippets. Her ever present goggles remained firmly fixed over her eyes allowing her to live inside a virtual world projected over the real room.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” he asked her and she chirped, ears flicking up before she shook her head.</p>
<p>“This is a mess, it sounds more like a clash of personalities and pride than actual legitimate objections. I know Ambassador F’rarrk, he was in my socio-economic politics class back at University, he is awesome but very young to be a S’grael ambassador.”</p>
<p>“No younger than us being Illuminate representatives,” Seinu frowned, “Do we know how F’rarrk got appointed?”</p>
<p>“No,” Chantelle said, “When I see him I’ll try and bring it up in conversation, what do we know about Embassy T’lorp?”</p>
<p>“The Farndos representative seems like a pretty standard choice to me, a colony of diplomats, they have been the trade representative on Homestead for the past thirty galactic years.”</p>
<p>“But something has clearly gone wrong,” Chantelle said lifting her goggles to peer at Seinu, “This doesn’t add up, the S’grael have been living on the world they are in dispute over for seven hundred years, there is even precedent in local coalition rules for planets deemed “Within Influence” from before a new race achieves galactic civilisation standing.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Seinu frowned and turned to look at Homestead as it loomed larger in the window, “But now the Farndos are kicking up a stink over it, the S’grael do not want to move and it is so weird, like that planet would be the worst environment for a Farndos colony, it’s a desert so why are they all arguing over it now.”</p>
<p>“Well on the surface,” Chantelle pulled her goggles down, “It looks like nonsense, this reads primarily like F’rarrk and T’lorp hate each other and Negotiation Dalant has called you in for a fresh outside perspective but it stinks if you ask me.”</p>
<p>Seinu watched the space-station drawing closer. It was a very impressive sight, a central core of gleaming blue metal that housed the Administration wing, reactor and docking bays. Surrounding it were six radial domes of transparent crystal covering farm-land, parks and residential complexes and beneath each dome were the massive cargo storage systems for the quite frankly ludicrous amounts of food-stuff that was shipped in and out of the system.</p>
<p>The Cultarvian station provided food to about 1% of the galaxy, it was a massive trading post with a population of about 7.3 million, 43% of that population were Aliens, and about 27% of them were permanent residents not transient starship crews or merchants. The immense station was also not alone, ships were constantly coming and going, entire trade convoys of up to ten ships arriving and departing together as well as hundreds of smaller ships and several bulk-transports that rivalled the Odyssey in size.</p>
<p>“This whole situation reeks,” Seinu said, “We are either being set up to look bad when the talks implode or someone is playing silly buggers or there is another agenda here we haven’t seen.”</p>
<p>“What do you want to do about it?” Chantelle asked, “We’ll be in orbit in another thirty minutes.”</p>
<p>“For now we do a standard arrival, we’ll accept Dalant’s invitation to a reception this evening, meet everyone in a nice neutral setting but I want you to talk, get F’rarrk alone and try to work out why he was appointed to this mission.”</p>
<p>Seinu picked up a tablet and scrolled through the data then slid it back across the desk to his sister, “Give this to Selenu, ask her to submit this request to Ck’akk I want… some independent verification of a few things”</p>
<p>Chantelle scanned the tablet and her ears went up, “This is… are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Seinu said, “Ck’akk can appoint a reconnaissance pack, then check our social schedule, we’ll go through the motions, everyone will want to host an informal welcome gathering so talk to Taran about organising ours here on the Odyssey, hopefully I can pick up some of the undercurrents to this mess whilst we are all pretending to have parties.”</p>
<p>“You’re worried?” Chantelle said as she tucked the tablet with Seinu’s instructions into the sleeves of her over-mantle.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the silver Avali sighed, “Joining mid way through like this is weird, I am going to have to try and untangle what is going on, what has been said, who has done what all from a disadvantageous position it is not going to be easy.”</p>
<p>“Well I’ll try to get reacquainted with F’rarrk this evening,” she said as she stood up, “Anything else?”</p>
<p>Seinu stared at the station for a moment then double-tapped his desk, shutting off all the screens and shook his head, “No, nothing else, I better go change for my grand arrival I’ll take Taran with me and whoever Firi appoints and see you at tonight’s reception.”</p>
<p>Chantelle nodded and hurried out of the room and Seinu made his way toward the private rooms attached to his office. He was going to have a long bath and get dressed, all the while playing over the information he’d been sent, fitting facts and figures, notes and reports together to try and untangle how what should have been a simple negotiation had turned into such a mess, something was very wrong.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3I9Gf5e.png"></p>
<p>Seinu’s official arrival on Homestead was a quiet affair, his shuttle docked at a shuttle bay reserved for VIP guests in the lower half of the central core. A Cultarvian functionary greeted his party, a tall, thin fellow in a burgundy outfit which complimented his deep black fleece. He had impressive bronze horns and hooves and a friendly disposition.</p>
<p>“Ambassador Seinu welcome,” they said warmly, taking hold of Seinu’s hand in both of his and squeezing it gently in greeting, “I am Secretary Elegon, Negotiator Dalant’s chief of staff welcome aboard.”</p>
<p>Seinu smiled and nodded his head, ears facing forward, “Greetings Elegon, it is a pleasure to be here, it’s been quite a few years since I last passed through Homestead.”</p>
<p>“We are happy to have you back,” Elegon baaa’d softly, his native tongue being translated through the translator built into Seinu's visor, “I know Negotiator Dalant was relieved to hear the Odyssey had accepted our request for aid, things have been proving difficult.”</p>
<p>“So I understand,” Seinu smiled then motioned, “This is my pack-brother Taran, and my pack-sister Firi.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you,” Taran smiled, he was wearing a long mantle and kilt much like Seinu’s, the deep royal blue a complimentary shade against his orange feathers.</p>
<p>“Yeah, good to be here,” Firi said, she was wearing armour, the dark metal-ceramic plating gleaming softly with small points of illumination, “These are my team,” she nodded at the twins who were dressed in similar power-armour, “Cri and Cal, they’re part of Seinu’s protection detail.”</p>
<p>Elegon blinked and looked at the bunnies, clearly unfamiliar with such aliens, “Welcome aboard, though I can assure you we take the safety of our visiting diplomats quite seriously, you have nothing to fear here.”</p>
<p>“I am glad to hear it,” Taran said with a smile, “Though, I am detecting at least five different cameras recording us right now?” he raised one hand to his head and his eyes made a soft whirring clicking sound, “All of them on separate, isolated networks that are not part of your security network, sorry to bring it up but it is sort of our job.”</p>
<p>Elegon paused, his face going blank for just a second, his ears twitched then he was all smiles again, “This is the diplomatic wing there are a lot of people who are interested in who arrives and leaves, our security services allow a small level of espionage in the form of cameras to keep the reporters, paparazzi and reporters happy, I assure you if there was reason for greater security those cameras would be blocked.”</p>
<p>Seinu placed an hand on Taran’s arm, wing feathers rustling, “As you say, it’d be impossible to keep the reporters out, better to let them think they’ve snuck in for their hunt of the exclusive, you’ll have to forgive my pack, it’s their job to think of these things.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Elegon nodded, trying to ignore the way Cri and Cal had spread out and were clearly watching the room, “I remember how important the pack is to Avali, shall we go? Negotiator Dalant has asked me to escort you straight to the reception he is hosting in Dome-Exi.”</p>
<p>“Of course lead on,” Seinu smiled and the Cultavarian led them through to an elevator which rose up the central core then curved around to travel in a loop along the connecting spars that led out to one of the domes. Seinu and Taran made polite small talk whilst Firi and the twins kept watch, professional and quiet as always when they were working.</p>
<p>The elevator deposited them in a covered plaza situated in the centre of the dome. The area had been transformed into a sculpture garden, tall, twisting, clockwork motion designs that rippled and moved back and forth beautifully; made from pearlescent metals that caught the light and refracted it into a living rainbow. It was magnificent and Seinu was quite sure the twins would have been enraptured by the sight if they were not being so serious right now.</p>
<p>Smiling at the beautiful site Taran made some pleasing comments as they wound their way out of the sculpture garden toward one of the waiting towers. Dome-Exi was the smallest dome, dedicated to visiting dignitaries, permanent embassies, station administration and government bureaus. Seinu’s ears flicked from side to side as he processed all the sound as they crossed the street beyond toward the central tower and whatever reception was planned.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3I9Gf5e.png"></p>
<p>Cal watched the room, his visor tagging dignitaries and identifying them for him. The grey and copper bunny felt very out of place, he was wearing the snug, perfectly fitting armour Firi had made for him. Its black and yellow scheme made it very hard to lurk in the background and blend in, he really didn’t like it.</p>
<p>He was just standing in public, everyone could see him which was still very weird, even after months of training it was odd to be just standing around and not hiding anything. Seinu was doing whatever it was he did at these parties, holding a drink he wasn’t really enjoying and making small, inconsequential talk with aliens. The aliens were fascinating, so many different types, not just the kind who were at the centre of this dispute. Oddly the S’grael ambassador hadn’t arrived but the Farndos was here, he really was a big gelatinous mass of deep green moss sitting inside a sort of half-cup container that was floating across the floor. </p>
<p>Cal was fascinated by just how alien they looked but he was feeling uncomfortable about being in public. Taking a few steps backwards he stood beneath the spreading branches of a big orange fern-like plant and sighed softly. That was better, he could sort of pretend he was hiding under a bush back home and watch, listen and smell and keep their Seinu safe. It was amazing to see how popular and important he was, his time living with them as a bunny seemed long ago now. The silver Avali was the centre of attention alongside the Cultarvian Negotiator Dalant. His black fur and grey horns made him seem to blend into the backdrop of space outside the windows whereas Seinu with his visor, silver feathers and purple stripe really stood out.</p>
<p>Cal didn’t like it, Seinu was a big target, his metallic purple outfit shimmered and gleamed as well. Running his eyes over the party he started to check the tags on his visor, he wasn’t entirely sure what was wrong but all his instincts were screaming at him that something was up. He had just finished trying to find a pattern in who was talking to who when his communicator beeped indicating it was now on the pack security channel.</p>
<p>“Ok everyone,” Taran’s voice murmured, “We have something interesting here,” Cal tensed, glancing around the room to look for the orange and teal Avali. He was over by the buffet table looking for all the world like he was deciding what to eat.</p>
<p>“Ifelse has analysed the cameras I saw in the shuttle bay.” </p>
<p>“I wondered why you mentioned that,” Firi said, “What is up?”</p>
<p>“One of them is not broadcasting standard news feed channels and is entirely separate from the station's security grid.”</p>
<p>“That’s not normal is it?” Cal murmured he walked out from beneath his plant and started to wind his way around people toward Seinu, “Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“Very,” Taran said, “Those sort of news-feed cameras are normal, everywhere has them, but they are authorised and linked to the station’s security network so their security team can control them, the extra network is broadcasting on a frequency that is separate to the security net.”</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Firi asked, sounding very serious.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any theories yet,” Taran said, “But it is wrong, this whole situation seems wrong.”</p>
<p>Cal glanced up at Seinu as he stepped up beside him and the Avali smiled, “Oh Cal, and Cri too excellent, the S’grael ambassador is here, I’d like you to meet F’rarrk.”</p>
<p>Cal turned and squeaked in surprise at the huge worm slithering over the floor toward them. He had to be twice the size of anyone else in the room with thick grey scales and a massive head that opened up into a ring of teeth! Cal gripped the handle of his sword and stepped in front of Seinu, at the same time Cri joined him, the two of them facing down the giant worm as it slithered forward.</p>
<p>It’s head opened up into a pit of teeth, serrated, angular teeth, three layers of them that then vanished into the deep dark of its throat. </p>
<p>“Hello Seinu,” they hissed in their own language, “How nice to see you, your bodyguards seem somewhat jumpy.”</p>
<p>Seinu reached down and gently but firmly pushed Cri and Cal to one side, frowning at them both before turning his attention to the worm, “You’ll have to excuse Cri and Cal, they are still new to meeting so many aliens, how have you been F’rarrk?”</p>
<p>The worm-like monster made a soft chuckling sound, leaning forward, the long tendrils surrounding their head reaching out to brush Seinu’s mohawk, “I am well, is Chantelle not here? I would have liked the chance to see her again.”</p>
<p>“She is back on the Odyssey,” Seinu replied, “I am sure she’d love an invitation to visit and catch up.”</p>
<p>Seinu and the worm continued talking and after being made to say a hello Cal retreated to stand nearby with his brother and watch the crowd. The party seemed to carry on for ages but eventually they made their way back to the shuttle and started to head back to the Odyssey.</p>
<p>“What was the point of that?” Cal asked once they were safely sealed up inside, “You just… stood around talking to everyone, I thought we were here to help fix the standoff?”</p>
<p>Seinu glanced around from the window and smiled, “We are, that was just the meet and greet, letting everyone know I am here, talking to people, seeing what people are saying.”</p>
<p>“But… How did that help?” Cal asked with a frown, “You didn’t make a start on solving any of the stuff we are supposedly here to do?”</p>
<p>“But it did,” Cri said, “Seinu and Taran were eavesdropping on everyones conversations and the pack was listening and reviewing them back home.”</p>
<p>“That’s correct,” Seinu said, “We learnt a lot just by listening,” he ruffled Cri’s head fur, “I am more interested in why you two jumped in front of me and F’rarrk like you expected him to try and eat me.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Cal tugged on his ears, “He scared us, he was clearly a deep eater!”</p>
<p>“A what?” Taran asked with a frown, “I’ve not heard a S'grael called that before.”</p>
<p>“Not a S'grael,” Cri said shaking his head and lifting up his glasses, “A Deep Eater, horrifying predators who lurk in the depths far beneath our cave homes.”</p>
<p>“Remember when you were living as a bunny Seinu? We wouldn't let you go down into the lowest tunnels as they are the lairs of the Deep Eater.”</p>
<p>“They are terrifying, massive creatures who burrow beneath our caverns and lunge out of the dark to swallow bunnies in one gulp.”</p>
<p>“What does this have to do with the S'grael ambassador?” Taran asked, scratching at his short crest feathers in confusion.</p>
<p>“He looks exactly like what we were told a Deep Eater looks!” Cal chirped, “I could see straight down his throat! I'd have fitted in with space to spare. I was worried he was coming to eat me!”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Seinu smiled and knelt down to hug both of the bunnies, squeezing them in his arms as he chuckled, “I promise F'rarrk won't ever hurt you, he is the kindest sweetest giant worm you'll ever meet.”</p>
<p>“It was still scary,” Cal grumbled, licking Seinu's muzzle affectionately, “I have never been so scared, I could see straight down his throat.”</p>
<p>“I promise you have nothing to worry about,” Firi said firmly, “At least not from the S'grael, but there is clearly a game being played here and it's not the Farndos or the S'grael.”</p>
<p>Seinu looked at Firi, his ears canting towards her, “You’re sure?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Selenu and Chantelle can give us a full review back on the ship but the S'grael and the Farndos seem genuine, but someone is messing up these talks.”</p>
<p>“Any idea on who?” Seinu asked, his ears canting back as he frowned, “Or is it too soon?”</p>
<p>“Too soon,” Firi said, “Some of the other ambassadors seem inordinately pleased with themselves that you are here, others are very confused why the Cultarvian would admit weakness by inviting in you, others seem relieved. There is a lot of trade and good will riding on solving this.”</p>
<p>“Who stands to gain the most if Farndosa and S'Graelan go to war?” Cri asked, “From what I could hear no one benefits if this comes to blows but some of the others in the rooms said it looked like it was going to spiral into a conflict.”</p>
<p>“No one,” Seinu sighed, “That’s the puzzle, but someone is trying to tip this into a war that much is clear, T'lorp and F'raark are so angry with each other they are only communicating through Dalant and some of their allies, it's a big mess.”</p>
<p>“Which is why I need you two on top form,” Firi told the bunnies, “Seinu is in even more danger than I was expecting.”</p>
<p>“Firi,” Seinu objected, “I…”</p>
<p>She cut him off, “No,” she said firmly, “You listen, someone has manipulated us here to “help” but it's a powder keg ready to blow up in your face. Now brother, I believe you'll untangle it and when it becomes clear you're going to expose this conspiracy they'll not sit back idly. If they can't embarrass you they'll assassinate you, the Avali ambassador being murdered just as he's about to broker peace will make this explode, especially if all the evidence makes it look like T'Lorp or F'rarrk ordered it which you can guarantee it would, you may be a big blob of slime but you are immortal.”</p>
<p>Seinu sighed, ears wilting and a frown on his muzzle, he nodded, “You’re right, our only advantage right now is us being late, us not arriving when expected has caused issues, they've lost momentum, forcing this stalemate to continue for an extra two weeks.”</p>
<p>“Don't worry,” Cal chirped, “We’ll keep you safe Seinu, you do your thing we'll do ours, no one will hurt you on our watch.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Cri confirmed, “No one will get past us whilst you fix this.”</p>
<p>“Thanks boys,” Seinu closed his eyes and leant into their soft, warm fuzzy bunny hugs then his ears perked up and he stared out the window for a moment, “Hmm.”</p>
<p>“You have an idea?” Firi asked.</p>
<p>“Maybe, let me think on it,” he walked over to sit in his chair and stared out the window at the Odyssey as it approached, lost in thought. Cal left him to it but watched their home move closer, he was curious to see what Seinu did next.</p>
