<p><h1>Main characters</h1></p>

<h2>Rowi</h2>
<img align="left" src="/MMFComic/your_content/images/cast/rowi.png" width="200px" />
<div align="left"><font color="#ff4400">Name: </font> Rowi Ouakkia (On Earth: Rowi D&auml;nkelsaft)<br /><font color="#ff4400">Species:</font> Avali<br /><font color="#ff4400">Age:</font> 27 Galactic Years (35 Earth Years)<br /><font color="#ff4400">Pronouns:</font> He/Him<br /><font color="#ff4400">Likes:</font> Computers, D&ouml;ner kebabs, peace, Animal Crossing.<br /><font color="#ff4400">Dislikes:</font> War, fights, entitled people, injustice.</div>
<div align="left"><font color="#ff4400">Languages:</font> Avali Core, Avali (Rowi&rsquo;s pack dialect), German, English, a bit of Spanish.<br /><font color="#ff4400">Role:</font> Drummer<br />
<p>Rowi is a dark grey, reddish pink and white Avali who came to Earth with the goal of studying its music culture. A good-natured raptor who became the drummer of the band. After settling in Berlin (Germany) for some years. Rowi got the German citizenship in 2013, and in 2017 he returned to Protion (the moon he came from) taking Sher (who by then had became his boyfriend) with him.</p>
<p>Aside to the musical scene, Rowi has a relatively broad knowledge of hacking and electronics, along with studies in geology; that&rsquo;s his actual formal job aside to the music band.</p>
<p>While his home planet doesn&rsquo;t pose any problem, Rowi&rsquo;s vision has heavy problems with the lights of other planets, including Earth. That&rsquo;s where his glasses come to use. These essentially process images in real time and deliver a filtered video feed with brightness, color, contrast, etc. adjusted to match his eye tolerance, dulling down bright environments and enhancing dark ones. Without these glasses he&rsquo;d be virtually blind in most of the universe.</p>
</div>
<h2>Sher</h2>
<img align="left" src="/MMFComic/your_content/images/cast/sher.png" width="200px" />
<div align="left"><font color="#ff4400">Name:</font> Sher Ouakkia (on Earth: Sher B&ouml;hnchen)<br /><font color="#ff4400">Species:</font> Vampire Bunny<br /><font color="#ff4400">Age:</font> 25 GY (32 EY)<br /><font color="#ff4400">Pronouns:</font> He/Him<br /><font color="#ff4400">Likes:</font> Pasta, punk rock, pretty colors, fractals and mirages<br /><font color="#ff4400">Dislikes:</font> Pollution, tofu</div>
<div align="left"><font color="#ff4400">Languages:</font> Vampire Bunny Song, Avali Core, Avali (Rowi&rsquo;s pack dialect), Spanish, German, English, Italian, a bit of Finnish, a bit of Japanese.</div>
<div align="left"><font color="#ff4400">Role:</font> Guitarist, singer<br />
<p>Sher is a vampire bunny, yellow and white, wearing a visor most of the time, but also ocassionally a red hat and/or a red scarf. He&rsquo;s a good natured sweet boy who decided to visit Earth after his sister did it and returned with extremely positive opinions of it and the beautiful views you could get. His sister gifted him an acoustic guitar, a black colored one with the picture of some palm trees in white. He arrived to Earth in 2006 expecting just to be a visitor but fell in love with the planet and decided to stay. He worked for a while at a small restaurant. He met Rowi in August 2007 who encouraged him to try to find a place to play his instrument.</p>
<p>Sher used to be very shy with people he wasn&rsquo;t acquainted with, but that has changed as his self confidence increased. He is the singer of the band. He also of stage fright to a degree but has managed to overcome and conquer most of it. While he tends to be careful with what he says in interviews, but if he&rsquo;s given wings, he can talk for hours about how much he loves his boyfriend and all the good things he sees on him, much to the poor Avali&rsquo;s embarrassment.</p>
<p>He has a big love for pasta, with gnocchi and lasagna being his absolute favorites. He can&rsquo;t stand tofu; he really loves the flavor of the Sprite soda in Chile and his most favorite Pok&eacute;mon is Pikachu.</p>
</div>
<h2>Daniel (D)</h2>
<img align="left" src="/MMFComic/your_content/images/cast/daniel.png" width="200px" />
<div align="left"><font color="#ff4400">Name:</font> Daniel Ouakkia<br /><font color="#ff4400">Species:</font> Deer<br /><font color="#ff4400">Age:</font> 24 GY (31 EY)<br /><font color="#ff4400">Pronouns:</font> Any, but prefers they/them<br /><font color="#ff4400">Likes:</font> Cartoons and movies (mainly Anime), Japanese culture, traveling.<br /><font color="#ff4400">Dislikes:</font> Being around people in general</div>
<div align="left"><font color="#ff4400">Languages:</font> German, English, Japanese, a bit of Avali Core<br /><font color="#ff4400">Role:</font> Bassist<br />
<p>Native from Earth (more specifically, west Germany), D is the bassist of the band. Originally sporting a very apathetic attitude, they have very little social energy; they like their bandmates and their families but that&rsquo;s about it. Usually after concerts they retreat to their room and just sleep or watch anime or read manga. Their anime library is gigantic, and while they like animes of all kinds, they have preference for either shōjo series or action anime with lots of blood.</p>
<p>While D enjoys being alone and all by themselves, they and Eikomi developed a warm relationship, that eventually turned into a romantic relationship.</p>

    <th><h3>Mekari</h3>
<p>A sleriki (slime-based species) who joined the band after he was at one of their performances and now its the roadie boss. Very gentle, sweet and soft spoken&hellip; but also very big, being around 7 meters tall (22 feet). His body has the consistency of ballistic gel, and as a slime he can make it harder or softer at will. This coupled with his extremely fast healing renders him immune to most kinds of ballistic or slicing weaponry, although he has a crippling weakness to ice. He developed a &ldquo;best friends&rdquo; relationship with Roi.</p>

    <td><h3>Roi</h3>
<p>Sher&rsquo;s sister. She visited space before Sher did, managing to reach Earth and live there for a whole year before coming back home. With a severe case of undiagnosed ADHD (that by now its controlled), she was clumsy at first and lost focus of things with extreme ease. She developed a &ldquo;best friends&rdquo; relationship with Mekari. She works as the head of security of the band.</p>

<h1>Rowi&rsquo;s Pack</h1>
<p>Rowi&rsquo;s pack is a group of avali whose work discovering and overseeing mining operations lead them to be very high in the Avali pack hierarchy, with rumors that they could join the Illuminate (Avali&rsquo;s governing body) in the future. However, they don&rsquo;t act like that, or maybe aren&rsquo;t even aware, who knows. Like it happens with all avali packs, they see each other as siblings.</p>
<h3>Sawi</h3>
<p><img align="left" height="25%" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/bc2a960cd283d06e0ea97ac55a3cf9c7/tumblr_inline_rxo6dlWH0I1trz0aj_500.png" width="25%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>A chill soul with very high work standards, she&rsquo;s the closest to a cyborg that the pack has. With four of the most invasive body enhancements and modifications of the group (A computer processor and a storage drive inside of her head, with direct connection to her brain, cybernetic eyes and her blood replaced with an artificial substitute to endure extreme temperatures), she doesn&rsquo;t need to rely in external hardware most of the time. Her computer additions make her extremely fast when she needs to run calculations or take decisions.</p>
<p>Sawi is the leader of the pack, and the spokesperson when either Eikomi cannot do it or when the pack is holding direct communications with the Illuminate leaders, and also works as the manager of the band. She and Sher also have a &ldquo;big sis/small brother&rdquo; relationship.</p>
<h3>Eikomi</h3>
<p><img align="right" height="30%" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/21f40f3e845c349e871e2481e36b746c/tumblr_inline_rxo6qjZwcv1trz0aj_500.png" width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>The official spokesperson of the pack and second in charge, Eikomi has a deep love for languages and communication, with interespecies communication being one of her biggest interests. She loves reading stories, fanfiction and watching anime. She likes to think of herself as a writer, having written several short stories (without much success). She has aspirations of becoming famous and loved everywhere someday. The tablet she wears on her left arm is very powerful and she uses it for everything, from checking maps to playing music.</p>
<h3>Naha</h3>
<p><img align="left" height="30%" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/31ea900f525fe491c0bdbd0942ec5379/tumblr_inline_rxo71pRdyZ1trz0aj_500.png" width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>Easygoing and nice, Naha loves videogames and has a small collection of them from all across the universe. As a kid he used to disassemble things belonging to the rest of the pack (and reassembling them afterwards). Today he&rsquo;s an expert with hardware, and he&rsquo;s responsible to keep not only the mining equipment working well, but the pack drones and robots too. He has built robots from scrap before, and while the pack doesn&rsquo;t need them due to the much more advanced devices they get from the Illuminate, he still builds robots and drones just for fun.</p>
<p>His most favorite kind of videogame are 2D platformers like Super Mario Bros, Prince of Persia or Commander Keen.</p>
<h3>Kig</h3>
<p><img align="right" height="30%" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6304d056c334cab7901197d6860cb30a/tumblr_inline_rxo78tSTIE1trz0aj_500.png" width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>A member of the &ldquo;Avali Defenders&rdquo;, Kig is the &ldquo;guard&rdquo; of the pack, boasting deep knowledge about avali weaponry (including vehicles) and armor. He will always be ready to defend his pack from any enemy who happens to cross paths with them.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not very talkative and enjoys not being the center of attention, usually staying silent and just listening, absorbing information and being ready in case anything important looks about to happen. He&rsquo;s also often away training.</p>
<h3>Kalani</h3>
<p><img align="left" height="30%" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/40684bea2b3fc69a2c5aa95be7b33249/tumblr_inline_rxo7esNyli1trz0aj_500.png" width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>A workaholic bird who loves technology, computers, tablets, gadgets, etc. He also loves programming, to the point that several of the apps used by his pack were programmed by him. He often collaborates with Naha writing the code to control the drones and robots his brother builds.</p>
<p>Thanks to Rowi he owns some Earth computers. Hacking and investigating them became one of his most favorite hobbies. As part of said investigation, he started learning the programming languages &ldquo;Python&rdquo; and &ldquo;C++&rdquo;.</p>

<h1>Sher&rsquo;s parents</h1>
<h3>Khi</h3>
<p><img align="left" height="25%" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2721f64a188320ace04f8fc4a75afb00/tumblr_inline_rxo7tgIwx81trz0aj_500.png" width="25%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>Sher&rsquo;s father and one of the Elders in Sher&rsquo;s home village, while he&rsquo;s afraid of space he&rsquo;s permissive and lets his son and his daughter explore it at will.</p>
<p>While his views are shaped by the recent horker invasion that almost wiped out vampire bunnies for good, the time he went to space to watch one of his son&rsquo;s shows he mentioned that space wasn&rsquo;t so bad and that he could even like it if he had been younger. He&rsquo;s the voice of reason in his family and following the traditional vampire bunny hierarchy, its head.</p>
<p>His hat has a pom and the design of his hat&rsquo;s wings has spikes and lines.</p>
<h3>Nau</h3>
<p><img align="right" height="25%" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/4964118163c0c4807e2e9e57b495e360/tumblr_inline_rxo7tt41lD1trz0aj_500.png" width="25%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>Sher&rsquo;s mother and one of the Elders in Sher&rsquo;s village, she was terrified of space and hated it, being frustrated at the fact that both her son and her daughter actually love it. Her bitter attitude was just concealing her insecurity and fear for what could happen to her son and her daughter, but and in reality she loves them with all she has.</p>
<p>In spite of everything, she actually likes both Rowi and D, and she&rsquo;s thankful of the fact that her son surrounded himself with good company.</p>
