<p>One &ldquo;problem&rdquo; that I see with a lot of long-form webcomics is that sometimes they&rsquo;re unfriendly for people who come to read when the comic has been going for a long time. Having to read (literal) hundreds of pages to catch up just to make sense of what&rsquo;s going on is sometimes can feel like a chore, over all when the comic has fillers and lots of arcs going on, or if the reader&rsquo;s internet is not good. I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>The idea behind this page is narrating what happened in each chapter, so any reader new to the comic can have an idea of what&rsquo;s going on in current chapters without needing to go all the way back. For that same reason, <strong>this page will have spoilers for each chapter.</strong> Don&rsquo;t go forward if you intend to read the past pages yourself! Use the &ldquo;<a href="/chapters/">Chapter list</a>&rdquo; link instead! Then you can go back and read the pages yourself at your own pace when you can/feel like it.</p>
<p><h2>Chapter 1: The Gig</h2></p>
<p><img align="left" src="/your_content/comics/01-00/00.png" width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>This chapter acts as an introduction to the comic itself. It starts with an alien rock band (whose name is &ldquo;Moumantai Motherf★ckers&rdquo;) playing at some space station, then introduces the characters one by one; First D the deer, the bassist of the band, whose personality is a bit distant because they don&rsquo;t like people, then Sher, the vampire bunny who is good natured but a bit shy and suffering from some stage fright, then Rowi the Avali, who acts like the brain and the pilot of the group.</p>
<p>The comic moves on with the band receiving an e-mail for a gig at some planet. They decide to go, and after going through said planet&rsquo;s border control, they&rsquo;re contacted by the members of a very tall slime species. The alien contacting them, whose name is Mekari, asks the band to go to a secret underground cave the next day to explain what&rsquo;s going on. They decide to go, and they learn that the slime species is not native to the planet, that they have to live hidden and that they would love MMF to perform for them as a way to boost their morale. They happily do so, only charging for the cost of the fuel and maybe some supplies. After the concert, Mekari is blown away and asks the band if he could join them as a roadie, and the band promises to think about it.</p>
<p>The chapter also uses one page to introduce a cruel species known as &ldquo;Horkers&rdquo;, with their leader being furious for not being able to use vampire bunnies (Sher&rsquo;s species) as cattle and food.</p>
<p><h2>Chapter 2: Family Values</h2></p>
<p><img align="left" src="/your_content/comics/02-00/00.png"  width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" />This chapter focuses on Sher&rsquo;s family. At first we have Sher telling Rowi that he&rsquo;s worried about meeting his parents again after 10 years, because after vampire bunnies were almost wiped out of existence there&rsquo;s a lot of social pressure for repopulating, and he&rsquo;s not going to do that. During the conversation the comic shows how Rowi and Sher are very close and affectionate with each other. After arriving on the planet where vampire bunnies live and some tears from Sher, the band meets his parents (Nau being Sher&rsquo;s mother and Khi being his father). We also meet Sher&rsquo;s sister, Roi. Sher&rsquo;s mom actually hates space and how her son didn&rsquo;t come back home with them as soon as he could have. His dad is a bit more permissive.</p>
<p>The conversation moves on to the fact that Sher isn&rsquo;t returning home; he&rsquo;s coming just to visit and see his family before going back to space. Its then that Sher&rsquo;s parents learn that he and Rowi are actually in a relationship, with Roi being the only one showing any excitement and happiness for his brother. After that Sher goes to his old &ldquo;room&rdquo; (that is just a cave, since vampire bunnies live in underground cave systems to protect themselves from predators) and discovers that there&rsquo;s an egg there. The comic then explains that vampire bunnies lay eggs, that they can only do so every other year and that the eggs require some unique light conditions to grow up correctly.</p>
<p>The story then moves on to Sher and Rowi back at their ship, talking about what&rsquo;s going on. Sher is sad that his parents are so distrusting of space, and Rowi explains that they&rsquo;re doing what&rsquo;s right, revealing that when they went to Sher&rsquo;s room Rowi actually discovered that the cave system was covered to the brim in Gabireum, a highly sought mineral used in nanocomputers. After that Roi comes to the ship, and explains in more detail that their parents hate space even more because before Sher she went to space herself, being out for a whole year.</p>
<p>The next mini arc revolves around Sher trying to write a song in his native language and being unable to do so due to how his language uses notes to portray words; in the end the band performs a small concert for the bunnies using only instrumental songs. D ends up becoming friends with the younger bunnies who started to call him &ldquo;D friend&rdquo;. Sher ends the concert essentially telling bunnies to search for their own happiness and take care of each other. The chapter ends with an emotive scene where his mom tells him to please stay safe wherever he is, and asking him to come back when he can.</p>
<p><h2>3. The Request</h2></p>
<p><img align="left" src="/your_content/comics/03-00/00.png"  width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" />The chapter begins with the band performing at the &ldquo;Awaken Open Air&rdquo;. After playing for 50000 people (and Sher fainting after the show), the guys use the money they earned from it to buy stuff: Rowi buys a crate of J&auml;germeister, Sher uses it to buy veggies for the ship, and D uses it to buy some anime blu-rays straight up from Japan. It&rsquo;s revealed that the band plans to leave Earth and not return for several years, so these are the last purchases they&rsquo;ll do on the blue planet.</p>
<p>Once the ship leaves they set up their route to Avalon (Rowi&rsquo;s homeland). The band uses that time to practice. However, a few days after that they&rsquo;re confronted by a pirate ship, who wanted the band to surrender everything and themselves to him. The band refused, and just kept on trying to escape; the pirate ship was armed to the teeth but it had an extremely weak shield, and the only reason the band didn&rsquo;t attack back was because the Iron (the name of MMF&rsquo;s spaceship) is completely unarmed. Eventually the band would lose the pirate by flying into the atmosphere of a very inhospitable hot planet, turning the cloak on in the middle of a lake of molten electrum and escaping in the opposite direction. Upon warping the band noticed they were way farther away from their destination than they wanted, so they went to the first inhabited planet they could find to refuel and clean the ship.</p>
<p>While this planet was inhabited by humans, that was irrelevant for the story because the people working at the border control were robots. Eventually the robots allowed the band to come in, and told the band to talk with the director of that landing base. This director, a long eared bunny named Auz'uls, used Avali core (a language the robots couldn&rsquo;t understand) to ask the band for help: He asked MMF to go to his own home planet, contact other bunnies and request a rescue, so he could be taken back to his homeland. The band accepted and left. Before finishing the chapter we can see that the robots despise Auz'uls and threaten to kill him if he dares to betray them.</p>
<p><h2>4. Always</h2></p>
<p><img align="left" src="/your_content/comics/04-00/0.png"  width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" />This chapter focuses on Rowi&rsquo;s family. It begins with the band recapping what they&rsquo;re doing and where they&rsquo;re going: They&rsquo;re heading to a moon near Avalon named Protion, where Rowi&rsquo;s pack is working. They will go to Avalon to buy things, but that&rsquo;s about it. After that they&rsquo;ll head to Auz'uls home planet to do what he requested.</p>
<p>After the band arrives on Protion they&rsquo;re greeted by one of Rowi&rsquo;s brothers, and eventually they meet <a href="/characters/">the whole pack</a>: Sawi, Eikomi, Naha, Kig and Kalani. Then D learns (along with the reader) that Avali put the pack before anything, that for them it&rsquo;s difficult to understand the desire to &ldquo;be alone&rdquo; that other species have, and that Rowi&rsquo;s pack see MMF as an extension of their own group.</p>
<p>Some hours later the pack gives some things to Sher and D; Sher gets a brand new headset and D gets a 3D &ldquo;camera&rdquo; and a new laptop. This breaks the deer&rsquo;s usual cold demeanor, and we then learn that D holds a deep resentment against their mother and that they&rsquo;re happy with never seeing her again.</p>
<p>After some bonding moments between D and Sher, the deer decides to stay on Protion, while Rowi and Sher go to Avalon to acquire things and upgrade the spaceship. Surprisingly, things happen exactly as planned without any setbacks; the ship is upgraded to the biggest tier available, Rowi and Sher upgrade their instruments and D uses that time to bond with Rowi&rsquo;s pack. After that&rsquo;s done the band performs a show for the Avali on Protion and finally leave to move on to their next appointment. While they&rsquo;re dining at a restaurant in the middle of space, they receive an invitation to participate in a huge music festival named, well, the Ultra Music Festival. They decide to accept the invitation, and they also officially recruit Mekari (the giant slime boy from chapter 1) as a roadie.</p>
<p>The chapter ends on a sad note when the band arrives at Auz'uls home planet: Everything is destroyed and the only things left are debris, smoke and a wireless data stream that could explain what happened.</p>

<p><h2>5. Nemesis</h2></p>
<p><img align="left" src="/your_content/comics/05-00/0.png"  width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>This chapter begins with Auz'uls being in a jail cell made of stone. One of the robots comes and releases him, explaining that they have no more need of him. Auz'uls wonders why he is being set free, but the robot doesn&rsquo;t really answer that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a small personal spaceship waiting for him. Auz'uls boards it; while he&rsquo;s doing that the robot tells him to get out and never come back; if he does, he will be treated as an enemy and shot on sight. Auz'uls acknowledges this and leaves. When he&rsquo;s escaping the planet he sees with horror how the planet is being ravaged with a flurry of explosions bigger than any nuclear weapon. Still in shock and tears, the spaceship tells him he has 1 new message. He opens it and it&rsquo;s a recording of Rowi explaining that he set up the message to appear only after Auz'uls had left the planet he was on. Then the message proceeds to unlock a folder in the spaceship hard drive that has the whole content of the wireless data stream retrieved from Auz'uls home planet. Auz'uls starts reading and loses his sanity almost immediately: Horkers (the evil alien species shown briefly at the end of chapter 1, the same ones who treated Sher&rsquo;s species as cattle and drove them almost to extinction) had attacked Auz'uls home planet; they tried to force his species to act as their diplomats, and when they refused, Horkers bombed their planet, essentially killing everyone. The stream proceeds to explain that Horkers are a lizard species that have aspirations to conquer the universe but that they haven&rsquo;t developed almost anything by themselves; most of their advancements were stolen from other species they had conquered. It was so bad that Horkers didn&rsquo;t even know what agriculture was.</p>
<p>Auz'uls decided to set the ship in the direction of the closest space station and activate the stasis system to essentially sleep for the 6 months it would take the ship to reach its objective.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in their own ship, the band is furious and coping with it the best they could; Sher growling and crying in his bed, Rowi blasting beats nonstop for hours. D used some candy and motivating words to help his friends snap out from their state of rage. After the band practiced together once more and had calmed down, Sher, still upset, explained he wanted to use his unique position to tell the world about Horkers and their atrocities. Not just what vampire bunnies went through, but also about the cruel things they were doing now, like destroying Auz'uls whole species.</p>
<p>After that the comic went straight to a different, filler arc: The band visited an asteroid named &ldquo;Isla del Sol&rdquo;, inhabited by a telepathic bug alien called Xunkiira. She is an old friend of Rowi, and she offered her place to let the band rest and recharge. The band then &ldquo;enjoyed&rdquo; a sauna (Sher loathed the experience) and the bunny saw a photo of Xunkiira with a human. Then there was their backstory: On Earth, year 1947, a spaceship crashed in Roswell, New Mexico. Politicians and aliens decided that it was a good moment to reveal aliens to the general population, and decided to take 30 years to prepare humanity to do so.</p>
<p>There was a flood of propaganda that put aliens in a good light, preparing people for the big moment. However, human&rsquo;s technology was way behind. Xunkiira was one of the aliens tasked with teaching humans how to push their technology forward. A human girl, Rachel, started showing interest in the topic and eventually both would become friends. In 1978 the existence of aliens was shown to the general population and Xunkiira had to go back home. She took Rachel with her, as both girls had developed feelings for each other, and both girls ended up settling in this asteroid, living together the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Rachel had passed away last year. While the band was laying some flowers where her body was buried, Rowi told Sher that he was totally on board with telling everyone about what vampire bunnies went through, explaining that he believes that someone who did good things should have the option of being remembered, and that wars usually deprive people from that. D approved of it too. The chapter ends with the band recording an anti-war song and starting to prepare for the upcoming &ldquo;Ultra Music Festival&rdquo;.</p>
<p><h2>6. Even flow<br /></h2></p>
<p><img align="left" src="/your_content/comics/06-00/00.png"  width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>The chapter begins with the band performing at a space station and practicing for their upcoming UMF show. Eventually Rowi receives an e-mail from the rest of the pack, telling him that they received an invitation to the UMF as well, explaining that since the band was going to perform, their families were being invited to witness it. Rowi&rsquo;s pack decides to take a month-long vacation and attend the concert. After that the band starts planning the setlist and Sher mentions playing a song named Cattle. This worries both Rowi and D; that song (the only one the band had by then talking about what vampire bunnies went through) had been played live only once, and they didn&rsquo;t do it again because Sher had been overwhelmed by his hate and ended up puking on stage. Sher promises not to do that again.</p>
<p>The band arrives at Warfaisser Station, where the event will be held. There&rsquo;s a lot of aliens there. After registering they&rsquo;re given access to a V.I.P hotel room.</p>
<p>After that the band goes to have lunch, and Rowi&rsquo;s pack arrive whilst they&rsquo;re eating. When everyone is having lunch together Mekari comes to tell the band that they should go to the reception area. Sawi and Sher decide to go and once there, much to the shock of Sher, they discover that the bunny&rsquo;s family is there too: Roi had managed somehow to convince Sher&rsquo;s parents to attend the UMF, since they had received invitations as well.</p>
<p>After meeting each other, the now very large group decides to go back to the hotel room, but not before pausing to take a group photo. Sawi hands out translators for the three bunnies, and the next day the band keeps practicing while everyone else goes sightseeing around the station.</p>
<p>Finally, after a successful sound test the next morning and looking at what the news around the universe were saying about the concert, the big day arrives. The chapter ends when the show starts.</p>
<p><h2>Chapter 7: Got the Life</h2></p>
<p><img align="left" src="/your_content/comics/07-00/0.png"  width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>The concert goes on. The band play several songs, some were original, some were covers from Earth bands. Sher showcases his ability commanding his audience, and at some point he mentions that he cannot allow himself to be scared with everyone who loves him standing by his side. After a while the stage goes dark and a light focus only on him, and he starts singing Cattle. The performance terrified his family with the inclusion of audio samples of bunnies begging for forgiveness. After that performance the bunny, now with his makeup very runny, sang <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7RvFUrx4kg" target="_blank">&ldquo;Invincible&rdquo; from Pat Benatar</a>. After some more, they finally ended the show thanking everyone for coming.</p>
<p>The next day Sher woke up very tired, and saw a message from Rowi telling him to go to one restaurant in particular. Once there he found everyone having dinner together. There we learn that D&rsquo;s dad somehow got ahold of their phone number and has been harassing them in an attempt to make D engage with them. After a while D just had enough and blocked them, explaining that their dad very likely was trying to get the password for the free V.I.P services that family members of the performers have access to. After some talk and explaining to Sher&rsquo;s family the dynamics of families on Earth, Nau and Khi told D that they considered him part of their family too, and he would always be welcome at their home. After that the dinner conversation moved on to talk about how apparently the Illuminate (the Avali government) wanted to learn about vampire bunnies and was likely going to send a diplomat to investigate Vampire Bunny society and culture. Then the conversation mentioned that Horkers (the same guys who destroyed Auz'uls civilization in chapter 5) are trying to expand their reach, but that they&rsquo;re terrified of Avali due to their superior technology and firepower.</p>
<p>Finally everyone goes shopping, and after that, they board the ship and head to Sher&rsquo;s planet, to drop his parents home safely. Is during this trip that we learn that Sher&rsquo;s planet is now named &ldquo;Babupekkakerok&rdquo; [&ldquo;Vampire Bunny Pack Land&rdquo; in Avali], that Nau and Khi aren&rsquo;t as terrified of Space anymore even if they don&rsquo;t like it as much as their children, and that they felt comfortable with Rowi&rsquo;s pack around. Roi doesn&rsquo;t waste the chance and tells her parents that she&rsquo;s going to join MMF and keep traveling through space. Her dad asks her to please do her best to stay safe, and Mekari replies instead of her, telling him that no matter what Roi does, he&rsquo;s going to be always there for her, protecting her with his life if necessary. This seemed to be good enough for Nau. The band landed on Sher&rsquo;s planet, Roi recovered some trinkets that for her had big sentimental value, D promised Nau and Khi that they would be back in a year or two and the band finally left the planet, ready for their next adventure.</p>
<p><h2>Chapter 8: Where dreams were born</h2></p>
<p><h2><img align="left" src="/your_content/comics/08-00/0.png"  width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></h2></p>
<p>Some time had passed. The band is playing on a random space station. When they finish, Sher goes to the bathroom and some guy smelling like booze comes and praises the band, and he&rsquo;s told off by Roi. Sher returns and tells the guy to get away from his family, calling him by name (Talirubi). This guy confronts Sher and asks him &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t enough for you to destroy my dreams? Now you&rsquo;re trying to publicly humilliate me?&rdquo;. After that, Mekari grabs the guy and takes him away. Rowi asks Sher about it, and Sher confirms that he knew that guy, that they shared history and that he was the drummer of MMF before Rowi came in.</p>
<p>The scene goes into a flashback from 16 years ago. A young Sher and a young Roi are getting fruit, hidden by the shadows of the trees. They hide as they see a predator, a winged creature with huge claws, and talk about how to evade it if they&rsquo;re seen. After that, nothing happens and and they return to a cave with their fruit hoard. They tell a group of bunnies where to find the fruit, and this group of bunnies thank them dearly. However, a few days later Roi didn&rsquo;t return. Sher&rsquo;s coping with the loss of his sister was hard; vampire bunnies usually try not to make super deep connections because they die often. The vampire bunny society encourages them to just move on, but Sher was very close to his sister. We see Sher joining a foraging party while still mourning Roi, and we learn that in the bunny society joining a foraging party means you&rsquo;re an adult.</p>
<p>We see the extent of Sher&rsquo;s grief and his struggle to cope with the loss of Roi when he starts dreaming of having adventures with her.</p>
<p>One year later, however, Roi returns. She starts telling how she visited a different place with lots of aliens of different sizes, shapes and colors, and how everyone was super friendly. This isn&rsquo;t taken well by Nau, who calls her out and tells her that she could have guided the enemies of the bunnies to the caves, reminding her that 85 years ago an alien species almost wiped bunnies out completely.</p>
<p>Later we see Roi gifting Sher an acoustic guitar (the same he is seen playing in previous chapters with the palm tree design on it), and they sit down to talk. Sher is the only bunny really excited for what she has to say about Earth, the planet she visited.</p>
<p>Some days later, another bunny from Sher&rsquo;s foraging party is kidnapped by a flying predator, and the party leader reacts by telling bunnies to use the few minutes of safety to grab all the fruit they could and run back home. Once home Sher, furious, decides to go to Earth like Roi did. And while Nau and Khi opposed it vehemently, Roi called Sher to her room (something extremely rare among bunnies) and explained what he needed to know to survive the trip; he had to get an EPP (Environmental protection pack) and that he was going to need a translator (Roi gave him hers). Some nights after that, Sher grabbed his guitar, packed it full with fruit, and did the same Roi did: He boarded an abandoned Horker vessel, an automated transport ship left by Horkers when they left the planet. This ship would come to Babupekkakerok every 30 days, stay some hours in the planet&rsquo;s surface and then leave, returning to space.</p>
<p>Once in Space, Sher saw a screen for the first time in his life, and he slept at a small room that had big boxes. However, while exploring the dark areas of the ship he found the corpses of bunnies that had died who long ago, scaring him into staying at the lit areas of the ship.</p>
<p>The horker ship arrived at an automated warehouse. After asking a forklift what to do (and the forklift replying), Sher traveled to a space station, where he panicked and got overwhelmed by all the noises and smells, something he had underestimated. Finally, he boarded a ship that was going to Earth, and there he met two humans, Benita and Gonzalo, who taught them more things about Earth. They were willing to pay for Sher&rsquo;s tourist identification and taught him about what a &ldquo;Shampoo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Soap&rdquo; were. Benita, being a music teacher, taught him how to play his guitar, and Gonzalo, being a lawyer and a politician, taught Sher how to handle and count money and how to buy stuff.</p>
<p>After going through border control, Sher received his first official id card and arrived to Earth, and they took separate ways. Sher was getting tired easily due to Earth&rsquo;s higher gravity pull than his home planet. He went to a bus station and boarded a bus that took him to the Chilean&rsquo;s coast; Sher got off in Vi&ntilde;a del Mar. After appreciating its flower clock, he started walking to Valpara&iacute;so. The bunny, looking at all the city lights in the distance, said that he was going to enjoy this, being on a tamed planet where he didn&rsquo;t have to fear every single beast in existence, and that this was a new beginning for him.</p>
<p><h2>Chapter 9: Chronicles of a New World</h2></p>
<p><img align="left" height="50%" src="/your_content/comics/09-00/0.png"  width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>The band is visiting the city of Valpara&iacute;so. While they walk around the city, Sher narrates his backstory and his relationship with the areas they&rsquo;re visiting. For example, how in one of the areas he was mugged and had to run away, and how he started busking to earn money to live. As work slowed down, he got a job in a small restaurant. The owner of said restaurant was a shady guy who was actually&hellip; not too bad. Meanwhile, Sher started knowing the restaurant&rsquo;s patrons. A group of young adults, &ldquo;the band&rdquo;, invited Sher to one of their gigs. The bunny accepted, and fell in love with the underground punk and metal music scene. He started attending concerts, and when he was returning from one of these in the middle of the night, Sher met Rowi, an Avali who had just arrived to Earth.</p>
<p>They talked and became friends. Shortly after, the restaurant owner got arrested for drug trafficking, leaving the Restaurant in the hands of an inexperienced alien who had no idea how to manage it. Eventually a relative from his boss came and took control of the restaurant, giving Sher a moderately good amount of money for his silence- something that came too late, as Sher had already told the police what he knew. Regardless, the bunny went back to busking, rented an apartment to live and purchased a laptop. Thanks to this laptop he was able to keep contact with Rowi.</p>
<p>One day, Sher was returning from a gig when he saw a small advertising about a rock band being formed. He decided to attend. The person setting up the ad was Talirubi, an alien that looked slightly like a weasel. Another person came for the ad, a bunny named Juan. They started practicing, with Talirubi telling Sher to replace his guitar with an electric one. As the story goes on, it shows how Talirubi was more interested in fame and popularity than in music, with the alien constantly bullying Sher. Eventually Juan told Sher that he was tired of Talirubi&rsquo;s attitude and he was planning to leave the band after their next gig. When Sher told Juan that he probably would do the same, Juan told the vampire bunny &ldquo;If you decide to make a band yourself, I&rsquo;ll be happy to help you&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Their gig happened; Talirubi, Juan and Sher performed in a small summer concert named &ldquo;Un verano Naranja&rdquo; (An orange summer). Sher committed some few mistakes but he recovered and the gig was a success. However, when they finished, all Talirubi did was to insult Sher and Juan, quitting the band and leaving after hitting Sher with a microphone.</p>
<p>Without a drummer, Sher asked Rowi if he&rsquo;d like to join, and Rowi accepted, showing to be competent at his instrument. However, since Rowi was living in Germany, they spoke and decided that Rowi would take Sher to Germany. Juan wanted to leave the band anyways, citing that he didn&rsquo;t really have the passion for music that Sher had.</p>
<p>After that, the backstory was complete. There was one more thing Sher wanted to do before leaving Earth, though: The band went to visit Benita and Gonzalo. Gonzalo had passed away in between (17 years had passed since Sher arrived to Earth), but the bunny still paid her back, also gifting her a DVD of their performance at Warfaisser (the one from chapter 7) and a handwritten note.</p>
<p>Finally, before leaving Earth definitely, the band decided to take D around some of the most famous of Earth&rsquo;s landmarks, since D had never had the chance to visit their own planet before. Once that was done, finally the band left Earth in direction to their next gig.</p>
<p><h2>Chapter 10: Forward</h2></p>

<p>The band is now more popular than ever, playing for different species and appearing at news outlets. It&rsquo;s revealed that Roi and Mekari aren&rsquo;t enough for handling the logistics of the concerts that were getting bigger and bigger, so the band decided that they would hire new roadies as soon as possible; Sawi had taken on what essentially is the role of manager of the band.<br /><br />Back on Protion, Sawi explains to Sher, Rowi and D that their next gig (the last gig before they take a vacation) is going to be for an underwater species; The Unmizu, a technologically advanced race of merman that want to study MMF&rsquo;s concerts to improve their translator technology. For context, they&rsquo;re not only the creators of the mini translators used by most aliens, but also the creators of one of the EPP technologies used by a lot of species around the universe to breathe and eat stuff and resist temperatures outside what they normally could. <br /><br />Sawi appoints Mekari as the boss of all the band&rsquo;s roadies, and Roi as the head of security and safety, with Mekari being her boss. Both gladly accept, and it&rsquo;s revealed that Mekari, due to being a Sleriki, is constantly getting offers for him to leave MMF and go work with someone else, with Mekari rejecting them. It&rsquo;s also shown that Mekari is technically blind to vision how we see it; Mekari &ldquo;sees&rdquo; with vibrations in the air and heat vision only. <br /><br />The band travels to Wakkr'y, the planet of the Unmizu, a planet whose gravitational pull and atmosphere are very similar to Earth&rsquo;s. We learn that there are two dominant species on the planet, the Unmizu and the Kuyorui, that have been at odds with each other for centuries. <br /><br />Once the band is driven underwater via a very long lift, they visit a beautiful underwater city, with houses made of rock and (resistant) crystals. There they meet the king of the Unmizu, who welcomes the band. While they&rsquo;re meeting underground, it&rsquo;s shown that the Horkers are starting to invade the surface. Unaware of all this, the band does their performance, and given that the intention is for the Unmizu to improve their translator tech, MMF plays an array of Earthian songs in English, German, Spanish, Japanese, Finnish and Italian, in addition to their own songs. <br /><br />When the band is exiting the stage, one of the king&rsquo;s guards stops them and tells them that they have been forbidden to leave. While the band gets obviously worried, the King explains why: He explains that Horkers are invading the surface and that they came with an army and that they want to uplift the Kuyorui, bringing them in line with modern space fairing civilisations. The Unmizu King tells the band that he already contacted Sawi and the Illuminate, also telling them that while the band are his guests, they have been given free unrestricted access to their best services, food, hotel rooms, technology, etc.<br /><br />Two days later, Sher is woken up by Rowi, they meet up and it is revealed that the Unmizu figured out a plan to let the band escape. The plan is essentially the Unmizu systems will guide the ship to a specific location on the surface before launching it, an EMP bomb will be used to fry all the vigilant drones and then, when the ship is far away enough the ships AI will takes control and warp the Iron away to meet a merchant fleet that&rsquo;ll be waiting for them.<br /><br />Everything goes exactly as planned; the ship is launched and they warp away. However, when they arrive, there isn&rsquo;t a merchant fleet, only a pirate ship, that uses a beam to immobilize the Iron (MMF&rsquo;s spaceship). The pirates teleport inside of the Iron, immobilize everyone and the chapter closes with another vampire bunny greeting Sher and asking him to cooperate.<br /><br /></p>
<p><h2>Chapter 11: Roots</h2></p>
<p><img align="left" src="/your_content/comics/11-00/00.png"  width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>The pirates are still holding the band prisoner. <br /><br />The captain tells MMF, however, that even if it is difficult to believe, they aren&rsquo;t the enemy. After some back and forth, the Vampire Bunny pirate explains that Horkers are preparing to go back to Babupekkakerok to take back Sher&rsquo;s home planet. He explains that Sher is famous and that talking about what Horkers did is putting pressure on them; Horkers wanna reclaim the entire planet now. <br /><br />Rowi asks why the pirates went through all the hoops to &ldquo;kidnap&rdquo; them instead of explaining what&rsquo;s going on in the first place, and a pirate avali explains that some protocols mandate that anyone from the Avali Corps helping pirates willingly has to be discharged and punished. Rowi argues that the band doesn&rsquo;t belong to the Avali Corps, but the pirate dismisses it arguing that whilst this is true, proving it with lawyers would be a resource drain. <br /><br />As they talk about this issue, the band&rsquo;s solidified bonds break, with one of the pirates explaining that they were just holding the band immobile for long enough to explain what&rsquo;s going on, not to keep them kidnapped forever. Sher asks the vampire bunny pirate if he wants to deliver a message back home, and the pirate replies nervously that his only home and family is the pirate ship. <br /><br />We get a flashback. Four vampire bunnies are carrying fruit back home; they rest in a cave during the night and when they prepare to resume the trip they notice a weird scent in the air. One of the bunnies touches soft soil on the ground, and suddenly all the bunnies fall into a pit trap. Two Horkers appear, and take the bunnies onto their spaceship, where they&rsquo;re held in what looks like a crystal cage. <br /><br />A few days later the Horkers warn their captain about something, and we suddenly see the pirate captain along with two other aliens teleporting in. They cause a ruckus, destroying things and releasing the bunnies. One of the bunnies follows the captain, trying to help with whatever he can, when the ship&rsquo;s captain appears and pushes a button. The pirate reacts with an emergency code, and they teleport out. The pirates and the vampire bunny (who was with the pirate Captain) are the only survivors; everyone else died when the ship self-destructed in an immense explosion.<br /><br />After that the comic goes back to the present. Sher is the angriest he&rsquo;s ever been. After being comforted by Rowi, D and Roi, D starts saying what they&rsquo;re thinking: The Horker King is not trying to conquer and destroy anyone right now; he&rsquo;s trying to boost his public image. All his actions are likely being motivated to acquire good PR. D then tells that they can&rsquo;t go against that alone, that they need to get the Avali Illuminate&rsquo;s help. So the band returns to Protion and tell Sawi everything. <br /><br />After thinking about it, Sawi explains that things may not be as straightforward considering Rowi&rsquo;s pack is just a mining pack, but that they&rsquo;ll do their best. That night Sawi tells Sher to come while everyone else is asleep. It is revealed that Sawi managed to get Sher an audience with the Head Pack of the Illuminate. It takes Sher a moment for that to sink in and he has a small panic. <br /><br />The bunny then calms down and talks in a video call with the Chief of the Illuminate (An avali named Ck'akk) and her advisors, starting very nervous at first but ending very eloquently. One of the Avali asks him if he&rsquo;s a licensed diplomat, and Sher says no. Then the Avali reveals that the Illuminate cannot grant the help request because he isn&rsquo;t an official diplomat for his species. However, they explain the protocol to become one, and that immediately after that, he can ask the Illuminate for help and they&rsquo;ll be able to process his request. <br /><br />Then the Avali explains that they like Sher&rsquo;s request to protect their species and family, because they&rsquo;re all about family and being a diplomat is just taking responsibility for your family. Then she explains that in spite of that, there are protocols to follow, otherwise the Horker King is going to try to argue against them if confronted and they have to make sure to follow the rules to avoid him being able to thwart them in the courts. <br /><br />Once the call ends, Sawi tells Sher that she feels something is weird. And during their family lunch the next day, Sawi mentions that she thinks the Illuminate already knew about what the Horker King is doing. Naha says he wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised; that the Illuminate is keeping a very close eye on the whereabouts of the Horker King. <br /><br />Finally the band decides to leave for BPE the next day at noon, and when they leave, Sher explains that according to the document sent by the Illuminate, Sher needs to get most of the elders of his species on record saying that they accept him as a spokesperson. Rowi tells Sher &ldquo;you can do it&rdquo; and offers him that, once the Horker menace is done, they could do an awesome concert for the vampire bunnies, to celebrate it. The chapter ends with Sher saying of course.<br /><br /></p>
<p><h2>Chapter 12: Streamline</h2></p>
<p><img align="left" src="/your_content/comics/12-00/00.png"  width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>
<p>We see a flashback. Sher and Rowi are out walking on Warfaisser Station, with Rowi commenting on how he loves to take walks with Sher, but they don&rsquo;t have the chance to do it often. After some small displays of affection, Rowi returns to the hotel room and Sher takes a lift to watch a sunset with a nebula.<br /><br />The lift goes down, with people getting out of it. Finally, only Sher and an Avali stay are left. The Avali asks Sher &ldquo;Are you Sher, from the Ouakkia pack?&rdquo;. Sher responds affirmatively and learns through his visor that the Avali he&rsquo;s talking about is Seinu, a diplomat Avali from the Trail Pack, a pack that&rsquo;s friends with his own. &ldquo;Our packs have been working together to build your spaceship, a very fancy one&rdquo;. Seinu replied affirmatively, commenting that he knew the Ouakkia pack had a Vampire Bunny but that he had never seen one. Sher comments on how Seinu seemed to know a lot about his family, and Seinu replied with &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard not to&rdquo; and how the Ouakkia Pack was the highest ranked mining pack on Protion.<br /><br />After that, the flashback ends and we see D, Sher and Rowi walking on Babupekkakerok. D is commenting about how much of a convenient coincidence it is that Sher met a diplomat, and Rowi comments on how he had forgotten about that and that Sher is extremely lucky. While the band keeps walking, they&rsquo;re called out by a bunny foraging party.<br /><br />It is then that Sher learns that Avali were at BPE the year prior, and that these Avali taught bunnies basics about storing food and defending themselves. Shortly after that, we see Sher explaining to his parents what&rsquo;s going on, telling them that Horkers intend to return to the bunny planet and that bunnies need a spokesperson if they want help from other species in the galaxy. Khi and Nau both explain that their opinions and attitudes are guided by their first duty, protecting the village and bunnies. Nau then says that yes, that they appoint Sher as their spokesperson.<br /><br />D meanwhile is holding a baby, that happens to be Saye, Sher&rsquo;s newborn brother.<br /><br />After that, a group of bunnies that were visiting from another village talk to Sher and they explain that they believe in him as well and tell him how to explain to their elders what&rsquo;s at stake and how to let the elders believe. While Roi introduces Mekari to her foraging party, the band is traveling in a vehicle in the direction of the closest village. D asks Sher about his own foraging party and Sher explains that he has no foraging party; that they&rsquo;re all dead. That he learned that when they came to the planet the previous time, and that he didn&rsquo;t want to mention it to sour said visit.<br /><br />The band visits an underground bunny village, where the elder explains &ldquo;We do believe you&rdquo; and that they did meet the avali previously, but that they have other matters to resolve. Sher decides to help them: They need to move away because the food of the place where they live is getting scarce and sick.<br /><br /><br />After the band goes to check for some possible places for that bunny tribe to move, they see the same bunnies who were visiting Sher&rsquo;s village. Then they learn that said bunnies did find an excellent place. Finally, MMF helps the village move, a process that would usually take months done in a few hours thanks to their vehicle. Once the move is done, the Elder explains &ldquo;You helped us even though you didn&rsquo;t have to. We&rsquo;re super thankful. We accept Sher as our diplomat&rdquo; and tell Rowi that while they met the Avali, they didn&rsquo;t have time to see how important family is for them until now. &ldquo;If you need us for anything, just ask us&rdquo;.<br /><br />After that, the band kept visiting bunny villages, helping wherever they could. Every single village said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to Sher being the spokesperson.<br /><br />After that, it was just a matter of waiting. Roi went foraging with her party, with Mekari being officially integrated into it. Sher spent his days learning laws as a diplomat, and Rowi got closer to Sher&rsquo;s parents, particularly Khi.<br /><br />Khi asked Rowi for advice. After the previous Avali visit, the amount of predators around reduced considerably, and everyone had noticed it, but he feared talking about it because it could make the foraging parties careless, something that could end in their deaths. Rowi told Khi that he should be honest, explaining that while things are safer, they should keep being wary of dangers, like the deadly plants. That the anti-predator net is not perfect. After that Rowi and Khi talked a bit about their feelings about everything, from space to Sher. While they were talking, Rowi had to interrupt: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time&rdquo;.<br /><br />Horkers had been detected and they were coming. They&rsquo;d arrive in around 6 hours. The chapter finishes with two Horker spaceships landing.<br /><br /></p>
<p><h2>Chapter 13: In Winter</h2></p>
<p><img align="left" src="/your_content/comics/13-00/00.png"  width="30%" style="padding-right: 20px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" /></p>

<p>We see a group of Avali in bed: They're the Illuminate leaders Sher talked with back in chapter 12. An Avali aide is waking them up. After getting up and grabbing some coffee, the aide explains that Sher managed to drive the Horker King away by setting up an alliance. When Ck'akk, shocked, asked how, she learned that when the Horker King was talking to Sher, about to take over the planet and announcing his intentions of doing so, Rowi stepped in and offered Sher an alliance in the name of the Illuminate: That alliance agreement would give Avali access to the natural resources in Babupekkakerok in exchange for being uplifted by the Illuminate. </p>

<p>Sher accepted immediately, while the Horker King, caught by surprise, just twitched his eye and, after telling Sher that "I'm a benevolent ruler and I recognize your freedom to make the alliances you deem right", took his armies and left.</p>

<p>Ck'akk, still not believing what she was hearing, contacts Sawi, who explains that what she heard is completely accurate. Sawi apologized to Ck'akk, and it's there that we learn that Rowi heavily overstepped the boundaries of his authority and position in a gamble that could have backfired spectacularly. Ck'akk, however, seemed determinated to make this work. Eventually the Illuminate decides to buy the contract Rowi did with the Vampire Bunny society, to honor it and be themselves the ones getting the profits for the new mining prospects, since Babupekkakerok is a planet with large mineral riches. We learn that Ck'akk wants to do this because she sees it as one way to counter the Horker King's good PR with good PR of her own; she doesn't want to let the Horker King use the excuse that Avali don't help others to sway people away from them.</p>

<p>We also learn that Ck'akk is right and the Horker King left peacefully for a reason: He has a big plan to take down the Avali civilization by using good PR, exactly as D had predicted a couple chapters ago. The Horker King was betting everything on it and didn't want to risk it, so he decided to just leave, stating that he could reconquer the planet in a future once he was the ruler again.</p>

<p>Rowi and Sher travel to Avalon, where they meet with Sawi. After punishing Rowi with a noogie for what he did, Sher and Sawi review the proposed agreement multiple times before signing it, making the alliance an official one. Right after that, J'ask (The leader of the Department of Avali Resources- Sawi's direct boss) calls the group and explains that he wants Sawi's pack to move to Babupekkakerok and oversee the entire uplifting mission along with the mining work. This comes with a very large increased salary, that would make an already rich pack even richer. </p>

<p>Babupekkakerok closes his borders to prevent other civilizations from interferring, and the Ouakkia pack moves to Sher's planet. However, after all the stress and work, both Sher and Rowi are so exhausted that they can barely stand up. Both Sher's parents and Sawi see this and she essentially forces the couple to take a break and go to Earth to rest for a few weeks. The chapter ends showing how new homes are being built at Sher's planet.</p>

<p><h2>Chapter 14: Junge</h2></p>

<p>The recap of this chapter will come once Chapter 15 is posted. </p>
