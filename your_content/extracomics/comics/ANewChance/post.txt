This was my first comic explicitly intended to be as tame as it could get, no fetish laden.
I originally started it because my parents were visiting and I needed to draw something they could stumble into without having to answer strange questions haha

The result is this.

This is a doujin. All the characters belong to The Pok√©mon Company. This comic IS NOT FOR PROFIT; this is just a labor of love.
