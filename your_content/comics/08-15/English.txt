Panel 1: “I spent 2 days in the space station, getting used to the odyssey of noises. Then I decided to continue the trip”. The worker there tells Sher “Yes, this is the shuttle to Earth. Remember to have your documentation, since customs will ask for it upon arrival”. Sher asks “What’s a ‘doco minty shawn’?”.

Panel 2: Sher is sitting down next to his guitar eating a fruit, showing how he was saving the food inside of his guitar. “I had two pressing problems, though: 1. I was running out of food, and 2. I needed to get some documentation to enter Earth. Luckily the ticket to board the shuttle was free. I decided to board the shuttle anyways and figure out the rest later.”

Panel 3: It shows a beautiful room. “After I boarded I was surprised. The room I was going to stay on looked cozier and bigger than anything I had stayed on before. The amount of space was massive, compared to my personal cave at home”.

Panel 4: Sher says, while standing at the room door: “I can see why Roi kept talking about how big everything is. This looks so nice!”.

Panel 5: Two older humans, a bald old guy with mustache and glasses, and a woman wearing glasses and a hat, appear. The guy says “Yeah, this shuttle has very nice rooms! It’s insane to think they’re free!”, and the woman says “Hello, little alien!”.
