Panel 1 shows the Iron parked on the floor. An Avali tells Rowi and Sher "A SCK-8840 Spaceship. Easy to upgrade. I'll give you the tablet, you have two options".

Panel 2 shows a tablet, and the images coming out from it. Sher says in shock "Woah! The image is sticking out of the tablet!". Rowi says "Yep! This is one of our '3D Tablets'. Try to touch the projection".

Panel 3 Sher says "Amazing! I can feel it! This isn't just a projection, I can actually feel it...! ...I want to buy one of these tablets later". Rowi replies "Sure!".

Panel 4 shows a layout that resembles a fish. "OK, to business. We call this layout 'The Fish'. It's great to keep things together, but I don't recommend it due to its verticality".

Panel 5 shows a horizontal longer layout. "The horizontal layout won't win 'cool points', but it's super easy to get cargo in and out, something we do often with the instruments and stuff. While we can rearrange our space freely, we are limited by the shape of our ship, even if rooms are bigger inside than outside". Sher says "You're right, I agree".

Panel 6 the Avali says "So... I assume you already decided which variant you want?". Rowi says "Yep! We want the horizontal upgrade".
