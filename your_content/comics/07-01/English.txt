Panel 1: The band is playing. Sher is singing Fur Evigt from Volbeat but in Avali Core. D is wearing some sort of robes, along with earrings with the shape of inverted crosses, and black face paint that resembles a beast skull with fangs. Sher is wearing a black tunic, and under his visor his eyes have face paint too, making him look vaguely like a raccoon but without stripes and the paint slightly runny from one side. Rowi is wearing a tunic too, the same face paint D is wearing and a black beanie with a white pompom.

Panel 2: It shows D playing his five string bass. He’s smiling under his face paint. Sher says “I hope you’re having a great time, Warfaisser! The next song is a B side from our ‘Coordinates’ album, it’s sung by Rowi and it’s called Unconditional! Let’s go!”.

Panel 3: It shows Rowi playing the drumkit from behind. Rowi is singing “♪ And when the fatal day comes, when you have to leave us, I’m going to follow you, in life or fucking death, in life or fucking death ♪”.
