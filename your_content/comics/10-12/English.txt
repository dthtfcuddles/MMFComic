Panel 1 shows the king talking to the band inside of a room in his palace. "Before anything, I want to apologize for the rudeness of my servant. I told him to stop you but forgot to tell him to be nice about it. Second, you cannot leave. I know technically we're kidnapping you, but let me explain why and I'm sure you'll understand us and agree that is for the best. Your safety is our priority, and letting you go now would put you at risk". Sher asks "What happened? What's going on?".

The second panel shows an army of horkers, with the diamond shaped ships standing behind them. Floating in an antigravitatory platform, there's the Horker King. "Horkers are taking over this planet's surface. They brought an army, and from the look of things, they're going to settle here for a long time".

The third panel shows the Horker king offering his hand to a species that look like bipedal foxbunnies wearing fur and a headband. The narration from the king continues. "According to our investigation, they were invited by the Kuyorui, the species ruling the surface. Apparently the Horker King promised them protection, and to get rid of us once they took our EPP technology for themselves".

The fourth panel shows the Unmizu King with a troubled expression. He says "I wonder what did we do that the kuyorui hate us so much. I looked for answers but found nothing. If we had been able to solve our differences, we wouldn't be in this situation. Anyways, you'll stay with us for a few days, while we figure out a way to send you home without alerting the entire Horker fleet, that right now is keeping tabs on anything moving on the sky or land. I already told Sawi about this. In the meantime, you'll have free unrestricted access to our best services: Food, hotel rooms, technology, etc. Your safety is our maximum priority".
