Russet: We wanted to make it clear here that Rowi had overstepped the mark here. The Illuminate COULD have walked away from it and left Sawi's pack responsible for what her brother just did.
This would have bankrupted the Ouakkia pack pretty badly. They'd have found themselves cut off and bounced out the bottom of the pack Hierarchy or cut off as an Independent pack.
So the fact Ck'akk wants to find a way to make it work is a good sign.

htf: Rowi needs to get a well deserved noogie for what he did. It was a literal gamble. And while it could feel a bit out of character, in reality it isn't; in my mind he was just trying to see for the bunny side of his extended family. Sawi is completely justified in being annoyed though.
