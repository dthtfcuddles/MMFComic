Panel 1 shows Ck'akk and her aide entering a room. Ck'akk says "wait, he just left? Like, for real and peacefully? This is certainly super anticlimatic". The aide replies "Yup. Everyone, even Sher himself were shocked that it worked, but as our law department told me, this puts us in a pickle, because what Rowi offered is beyond his legal capabilities, and if the Horker King learns about this, he will use it against us".

Panel 2 shows Sawi talking on a video call. "Yep, everything you were told is 100% accurate. I also apologize for my brother promising stuff on behalf of the Illuminate. He overestimated his and our position. Is there anything we could do to make this right?".

Ck'akk asks another avali "Sister?". This other Avali says "Technically speaking, the agreement is between the Ouakkia pack and the bunny diplomat, so in theory we can't do anything. However...

Panel 4: "There is a solution to all this, but it's something we have to discuss as a pack. So, take the next 3 days to rest. After that we'll contact you to set up the next steps". Sawi says "Okay. Sawi out" and cuts the communication.

Panel 5: Finally, Ck'akk asks "What's up sis? What is it you need us to discuss as a pack?". The other avali replies "Okay sis. Before saying anything, I'll ask you. Why are we doing this? Technically is just an alien species. Normally we wouldn't even care. At most we'd tell our ministry of foreign affairs to take care of this".
