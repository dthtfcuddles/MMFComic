Panel 1 shows Sher strumming his guitar and saying “YEAH!”. Panel 2 shows Rowi playing the drumkit. Panel 3 shows Sher sitting on Rowi’s drumkit rail while playing his acoustic guitar. Panel 4 shows D playing the bass but now with younger bunnies climbing on top of them.

Panel 5 Sher says “Okay, the next song will be the last one, but I want to say something before. I know some of you are very curious about why I’ve been gone for 13 years. Truth is… because I made outer space my home, and I formed my new family, the ones who performed with me today, in there.”

Panel 6 Sher continues. “Our parents tend to fear space, tainted with the memories of our slavers. And you know what? They are right to fear it! However, beauty often resides where danger lies, and we must take risks everyday”.
