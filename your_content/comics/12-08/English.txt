Panel 1 shows the hover car stopping. Sher says "We're here. This isn't a valley, but the white vegetation is why it's called the White Moss Valley". Rowi replies with "Got it. Our visors and the car are mapping this area in detail so it's easier to return later".

Panel 2 shows a cave from inside, and at the door the trio coming in. Sher says "I am 99% sure this is the entrance to the village, and I don't smell any predators around". Rowi says "Interesting, no igloo door like in your village, this looks just like a random cave".

The third panel is very dark. Sher says "Yeah that's normal. My village is a bit different from others: The cave entrance was way too big, so we built something with rock and ice. This happened before I was born, so I have no idea where they got the idea from".

Panel 4 is fully dark and only a small light is seen far away. D says "Without the Gabireum crystals, this cave is so dark I couldn't see anything without the help of my visor". Sher replies "This is why predators almost never invade bunny caves. They fear darkness, and we could smell them from very far away".

Panels 5 and 6 are just pitch black.

In the panel 6 Rowi says "Are you sure this is the right cave, honey?" and Sher replies "Yup, I can smell the faint scent of other bunnies on top of the grass".
