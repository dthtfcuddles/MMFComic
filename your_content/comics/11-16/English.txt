Panel 1 shows the entire pack eating around a large round table with a lot of things on it. Narration says "The day after, during the family lunch, Sawi and Sher explained everything that had happened the night before". Rowi says "I think you'd be a great diplomat, honey". D says "I know you wanted us to have a good night of rest, but you should have woken us up. We're in this together, after all". Eikomi says "These krüg slices are the glory". Saw says "This is what I think it's happening. It's just a hunch, I have no proof, but I think the Illuminate already knew what we told them. They were just waiting for a confirmation or an excuse to act". Naha says "I wouldn't be surprised. Taran from the Trail Pack told me the Illuminate is keeping a very close eye on the Horker King". Kig says "They have to. The horker king is trying to erode the trust others have in us while presenting himself as this sort of good savior".

Panel 2 shows Naha, Kalani, Kig, Mekari and Roi. Naha says "But... why are we dinning here, then? Sher should be going to his planet, not losing time with us". Kig says "Preparing and arming an army isn't a 10 minute job. It may take a while, potentially months". Mekari says "Even more if they're using their resources to uplift some other species, or do the arming in secret".

Panel 3 has D saying "While that may be true, I think we shouldn't lose too much time resting here". Rowi, holding a Jäger bottle, says "Oh, I know, we'll be leaving tomorrow at noon".

Sher, with his mouth full with food, says "mmffhh fank you eferyone for eferything, I don't deferve you all".
