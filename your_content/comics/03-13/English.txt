Panel 1: It shows a town that looks a bit persian influenced. “Welcome to bluey, a planet with a composition fairly close to Earth’s. It’s hotter, though, with its average temperature being around 25°C (77°F).”

Panel 2 shows Rowi with an expression of annoyance. “I’m an idiot! I forgot that we can’t wash and clean the spaceship here. At most we can try to refuel but we risk a huge fine too”. Sher says “huh?” and D says “why that?”

Explanation: “We were at ‘Sad balloon’, a planet with an extremely toxic atmosphere. Its microscopic shit got stuck to our ship’s hull. If we wash it away, that stuff has to end somewhere and here likely would poison or kill something or someone. The fines for bringing this kind of crap between planets are huge. If we want to clean the ship we must do it at a space station or at a proper facility that can get rid of it safely”.
