Panel 1: The group is looking at a big screen showing the galaxy. Rowi says "Two objects came out of warp and are flying in our direction. In a galaxy as quiet and remote as this one, I'm 100% sure these are the horker ships. They'll be here in 6 hours and 5 minutes."

Panel 2 shows the group as well, but from the front. Mekari says "That's not a lot of time". Sher says "He's coming with an actual army indeed. How many horkers would fit in two ships? Maybe he knows we won't be able to fight back and just want to intimidate us into submission".

Panel 3 shows the galaxy with two shiny objects. Rowi says "Yes, and that isn't a secret, I think. We're betting our cards on the diplomatic route. If the Horker King is trying to get good PR, he will not attack you, over all if you're with us Avali". Sher says "I know. Right now my goal is that no bunnies get harmed today if he doesn't care about having good PR. Bunnies will be there for show, but we can't really fight".
