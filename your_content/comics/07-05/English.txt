Panel 1: Eikomi, Sawi, Nau and Khi are in it. Eikomi says “We knew how much affection Rowi and Sher had for each other, but seeing it in person makes it feel real”. Khi replies “At first we didn’t like the idea of Sher being in love with someone from outer space… but when we learned who he was with… we both knew going against that would be incredibly cruel”.

Panel 2: It shows Rowi and Sher rubbing each other’s cheek with their own. Khi continues. “They’re very effusive with their affection, and we had to accept that Sher had found a great soulmate. Rowi is a good boy.

Panels 3, 4 and 5: They show the band playing their instruments one by one. D is playing while the song goes "♪ Show the blue rose to everyone, let your prized treasure be destroyed ♪”. The middle panel shows Rowi’s silhouette while another song goes, “♪ The coldest winter, a time for peace! Look at the sky while the blizzard roars! ♪”. The right most panel shows Sher with a threatening grin, singing “♪ Stop! Beat! Authority! Their time is not the same as ours! Is the time dilation! Yeah! ♪”. The narration says “And so, the show went on without any issues. We performed a mix of our own songs and covers from Earth songs we loved”.

Panel 6: Shows Naha and Kig. While Sher sings “♪ Master! Master! Ahahahahaha! ♪”, Naha says “They’ve been performing for two hours and they look as energetic as when they started! How much juice do they have?”.

Panel 7: It shows everything going dark, but with flashes of light all around.
