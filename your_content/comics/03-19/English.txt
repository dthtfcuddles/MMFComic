And Chapter 3 is done.

This chapter was interesting in several ways for me as a creator. Besides helping me flesh the universe personality a little along with the characters themselves, it helped me to develop the visual look a little beyond what I had thought at first.

This was, also, technically the last chapter of the “comic introduction”. While one could argue that Chapter 4 will also count as part of the introduction (you’ll see why when it happens), thing is, we have finally mysteries set in motion and it’s time to move forward. But not so fast yet; the comic is not just about the plot. At least for me.

After this, like the last time, I’m going into a small hiatus while I work in other stuff and prepare chapter 4, that should start appearing sometime during February. Thank you for reading! Feel free to comment or give me feedback or whatever.
