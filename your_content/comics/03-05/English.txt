Panel 1 shows Sher practicing with his acoustic guitar, and a tablet next to him. He says “Bm - Bm7 - E - E7 - E - B ♪ A mí me dieron el mar, y sus orillas ♪ Wait, no. It’s not B, maybe A? Let’s retry the pick section and go from there”. The narration says “The trip to Avalon was a long one. It would take us two weeks to arrive there, so we had plenty of time to practice and improve a bit with our craft. Sher decided to get inspiration from older songs we usually ignored”.

Panel 2 shows D sleeping next to their bass. The narration says “D would practice for around 16 hours with two meals in between, then they would pass out and would sleep for another 16 hours, then they would wake up and do it again. When asked them about it they just say “It suits me”.

Panel 3 shows Rowi practicing with the drumkit. “I personally kept practicing the same I always do. However, I think sher had a good idea when he decided to use old music to elevate his style. Maybe I should go back to the basics, practice rudiments or something of sorts”.
