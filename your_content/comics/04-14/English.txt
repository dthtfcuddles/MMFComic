Panel 1 shows the Iron flying by a city. "We are a nomadic species and that's part of our lifestyle, but that doesn't mean that we can't have big permanent settlements. But unlike human cities, most of ours (due to our limited space) are densely packed and mainly used to house infrastructures and services, not homes to live. Apartments and hotels are used to stay during temporary errands like in our case. Due to this, our cities tend to not to have much focus on the people, but on the services they provide. Places to hang out inside of the city are quite expensive, and also discouraged. This is so relevant that some surveys reported almost no Avali really enjoy being in a city".

Panel 2 shows Sher talking. "Oh yes, I forgot to ask, I see very few billboards, and the few ones aren't super bright. Is there any reason for it? I would expect otherwise from a big city".

In panel 3 Rowi replies "Ah, honey, that's because you're thinking of Earth, where vision is the primary sense. For us it isn't; if we had no visors or augmentations we'd be almost blind. Billboards are seen as a waste, most of the time".

Panel 4 Rowi continues. "The ship is silencing any audio from outside right now, but when we land you'll hear how many sounds and textures we have, because for us Avali hearing is our primary sense".
