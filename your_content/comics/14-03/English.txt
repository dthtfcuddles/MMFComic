Panel 1 shows Eikomi and D practicing bass, with Saye looking at both with a smile and a small heart on top. Eikomi is using D's old bass, and it looks like D is teaching her. She says "Index claw on E8, middle claw on D8, small claw on G9. This is hard". D says "You can do it. It gets easier, just muscle memory after a while".

Panel 2 Eikomi says "Hey, Daniel? Uh... I don't know how to say this. We Avali are all about our packs and our shared experiences and... I don't want to force you to talk about stuff you don't want to, but... I wanna know you better... and... yeah...".

Panel 3 has D replying to Eikomi while Saye hugs their arm "Ah, Eiky. I... I knew you'd ask about this sometime. It's... uncomfortable. But... um... let's drop the bass practice for now. Come with me".

Panel 4 shows Eikomi and D in the same place Rowi and Khi were talking near the end of Chapter 12, with two full moons and a starry night and the trees at the bottom.
