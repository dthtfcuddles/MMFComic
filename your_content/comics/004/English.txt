Panel 1: It shows the band’s spaceship at an alien parking lot, with other aliens walking around or parking their own ship. From inside Rowi says “So, apparently, they want us to play on a planet named RS-300 in a galaxy not far away. The e-mail looks legit. Sher replies with “Sounds interesting, actually”.

Panel 2 shows the avali using the ship computer, saying “I’ll get all the information we avalis have about that planet. We won’t live the SCR-455 experience again”. A small square gives additional information: “Name: Rowi Dänkelsaft. Species: Avali. Age: 25. Likes. Computers, döner kebabs. Dislikes: War, entitled people.

Panel 3: Shows Sher shaking and hugging himself while saying “The horker’s homeland? I still have nightmares with that from time to time. brrr”.

Panel 4: Shows Rowi still using the computer, saying “It says it’s a warm planet, and their inhabitants are nice and peaceful”
