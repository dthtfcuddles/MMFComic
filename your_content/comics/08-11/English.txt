Panel 1: Narration “I knew our parents would be upset, but I had made a decision. A few nights later, after I returned from a foraging journey, I took the guitar Roi had gifted me and her translator, said goodbye to my party… and left. It was a peaceful night. It felt almost like the whole planet was, in a strange way, supporting my decision and saying goodbye”.

Panel 2: Narration “That rusty, almost shapeless thing, was a ship that the Horkers left running automatically when they abandoned our planet a century ago. It landed every 30 days, would wait a couple hours, then leave again.”

Panel 3: “I knew Roi wanted to come with me, but we agreed that she would stay, to support the village and to calm down my parents. This moment… was my last chance to cancel my plans. To go back to my normal life.”

Panel 4: “… but no. I wasn’t going to go back. I swallowed all my nerves and moved on, trying to remember what Roi had taught me”. Sher thinks “Okay, before this thing takes off, I must find a magical thing named "EPP” that’ll allow me to breathe in space. Sounds easy enough".

Panel 5: Narration continues “And… well… it happened. I left my dear planet. The place I called ‘home’. I was terrified, but excited”.
