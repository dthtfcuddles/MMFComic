Panel 1 has Rowi hugging Sher while he continues. “There’s a big pressure for us to repopulate after our whole species almost got wiped out a century ago. A thing that, of course, I won’t be doing”.

Panel 2: D appears drinking coffee. They say “Does your family need to know you’re not going to date another bunny because you’re in love with an alien from some planet thousands of billions light years away? Just don’t tell them and you should be fine”.

Panel 3: Sher says “T…that’s impossible. They will know… as soon as they lay their eyes on me”.

Panel 4: D says “On Earth we have a name for families who don’t want their members to be happy: Toxic. And if your family doesn’t care about your happiness… you shouldn’t care about theirs either.”

Panel 5 shows the ship in the gravity area of a planet with two moons and a drone waking up. Sher says “You know, D, I’ve never seen you giving bad advice, but you could be a bit less blunt. That one hurt”. D replies with “Oh, Sher, believe me, I’m being as soft as a silk cloth. If I wanted to be blunt… you would never forgive me”.
