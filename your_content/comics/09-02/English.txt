Panel 1: The guys are standing next to several houses. Sher says “One of my first shocks was learning that this is how humans live here on Earth. You’ve seen how my home is, just a set of underground caverns and actually lacking any kind of technology.”.

Panel 2: Sher continues. “I also had a very bad experience that cemented something Roi told me when talking to me about Earth.”

Panel 3: Shows Sher about to be mugged. One of the muggers say “oe ermanito no teni gamba pa la micro no tenimo ni uno. Por ultimo pasa el gorro marciano conchatumare” [hey bruh dont you have some (money) for taking the bus. Or at the very leart pass the hat you fucking martian]. Sher says “m-may I help you? I can’t understand you”.

Panel 4 Shows Sher running in his fours while the two muggers pursue him with some very silly pose. They say “ven pacá mono chuchetumare, the la oi a metértela con ajo qlo” [come here you motherfucking monkey, i’m going to stab you after sharpening the knife with garlic]. Sher’s narration says “Not everyone on Earth is good or has good intentions. You’ll have to learn how to read people to stay out of trouble”.
