Panel 1 shows Mekari greeting a group of bunnies, with Roi next to him. Mekari says 'Hi, friends!', Roi says "He's Mekari. We work together and he's also my best friend. He's made of slime! And he has some super awesome senses! He can even see our body heat!". A bunny says "Woah! He's enormous! Bet he could beat a Silver Wing in one punch!", another bunny says "Hi, Mekari-friend!" and another says "Ohhh Mekari, you smell good! Like grass that was just cut!".

Panel 2 shows a hover vehicle traveling at full speed. D says "Hey Sher? I've seen how important foraging parties are for you bunnies, but you never introduced us to yours. Is there any reason in particular?". Sher replies "Well... D... it's because... well... they're dead".

Panel 3 shows Sher looking off the window while he continues. "I found out that time when you met my parents. When I went to talk to them before introducing you... they told me. My mom tried to blame me for leaving... but dad said it wasn't my fault. Both said, though, that they were happy to see me alive, even if mum was furious".

The last panel shows Rowi with a sad expression while Sher continues talking. "At the time I didn't tell you to avoid souring a visit that was already stressful. I was going to tell you after leaving the planet. But the chance to talk about it didn't come."
