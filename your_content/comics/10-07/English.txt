Panel 1: Shows the band going down some stairs, with the city in the background and a small waterfall in the forefront. Sher says "This is a super pretty city, but... where's everyone?". The Unmizu with them say "Asleep. The inhabitants of each city tend to sleep at the same time. You'll see a lot more movement in 5 hours".

Panel 2 shows a diagram and its explanation: "Unmizu cities are layered, with the top facing the water and the bottom being an artificial underground cave. The bottom usually has the most important buildings. You're going to play in the lower palace. This is a tiny city, but that's intentional; people from other cities will travel here to attend the concert".

Panel 3 has the band looking at a side while someone says "Yes! And I can't wait for your show!".

Panel 4 shows an Unmizu with a crown on his head and wearing a cape. "Welcome to Cytak City, and well, to Wakk'ry! I'm Kastai, the King of the Unmizu. You're our guests of honor, and we're having to have you here".

Panel 5 shows the king (that is twice as tall as Rowi) talking to the band. "Like I told Sawi, the idea is that while you do the show, we're going to be recording it with our own technology, so we can use this to improve our translators. This is also why we're sparing no expenses. Anything, you want, if doable, you'll get it". Rowi says "Yes, we were told about it".

The final panel shows a mothership and small diamond-shaped ships coming off it. The narration says "We were excited... but we had no idea what was about to happen".
