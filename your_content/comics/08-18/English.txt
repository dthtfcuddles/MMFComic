Panel 1: There’s a border control booth that resembles the immigration booths at airports. The narration says “Border Control was located on a space station only 650 thousand kilometers away from Earth. They asked me some questions, and I got issued an ID afterwards”. Sher is with both Benita and Gonzalo talking to the worker, who says “Coming as a tourist? Perfect. That guitar tells me you want to learn about our music too. Give me 3 minutes”.

Panel 2: It shows an ID card with Sher’s face on it. “Roi had never mentioned anything about an ID card, but I was ecstatic at getting one nonetheless. With it, I was ready to finally land on the blue planet I had heard so much about”.

Panel 3: “And finally, 3 hours after the whole border control kerfuffle, we arrived on Earth. Our ship landed in Santiago, Chile”.

Panel 4: Sher and Gonzalo are sitting down in front of each other. “Gonzalo gave me some sensible suggestions of places to go. He explained that while they’d love to receive me at home, that it was not the best season (the middle of winter), with ‘rain’ dominating the landscape”.

Panel 5: It shows Sher exiting the airport. He says “I understood. Besides, I didn’t come here to just spend all my time doing nothing at someone’s home. I wanted to travel, see things. After exchanging contact information, we went separate ways”.
