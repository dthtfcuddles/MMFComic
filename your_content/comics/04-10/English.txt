Panel 1 D is being hugged by Sher and Rowi. D says "I'm sorry, I'm making this awkward. Is just... I'm not used to this amount of kindness". Sher says "Don't apologize for this, D, remember that for us it's okay to have feelings". D says "Still I'm sorry, everyone. Thank you for everything. Apologies, I need to put my thoughts in order".

Panel 2 D is retiring. Eikomi says "I... don't get it. Was cutie crying because we gave them some things?". Rowi replies "Let's give them time in case they want to tell us by themselves tomorrow. But short answer, yes".

Panel 3 shows D laying in bed, their face half covered by the back of their hand. Meanwhile Eikomi and Rowi keep talking. "Why would anybody cry over getting something?". "Oh, Eikomi, it's super hard to understand for us because we Avali live in what we could call a utopia. But... I've been on Earth... seen how their society is and... let me tell you... their society is ruthless and often incredibly cruel and malicious. D has been at the receiving side of its worst".

Panel 4 D tells the air "Fick dich, mom. Not only I'm billions of light years away from you, without ever needinhg to 'beg for your help' like you wanted, I'm also exploring the stars <b>with my new fucking family</b>! A family where every single relative, every single fucking one has showered me with love and affection that you always said I didn't deserve! At least I agree with you in hoping we never see each other again!".

Panel 5 shows D resting in bed with their new laptop open and turned on next to it.

Panel 6 D is using their new laptop. "Nexus news, outer space, sector 725266224... Woah, they have news from Earth here? Let's open the first one... 'Most countries on Earth are enforcing quarantines after deadly virus strikes it. Exercise extreme caution if you're visiting the area'. What."
