Panel 1: Rowi says “I’ll ask this planet’s border control with an e-mail if there’s anything we could do about this to land safely and legally”.

Panel 2: D looks at the computer screen (they’re at the piloting room) and says “A reply in less than 15 seconds? That was fast”. Rowi replies “This is strange. The nexus info says that the inhabitants of this planet don’t like interacting with technology themselves. They couldn’t have replied this fast if that was true”.

Panel 3: D says “Well, this is my cue to go back to my room. Like always, just tell me later what happens and, if there’s any choice, what you decide”.

Panel 4: We see the ship flying above an oasis in a desert. Sher says “Do you think maybe the nexus has obsolete information, honey?”. Rowi replies “It’s a possibility, but my gut feeling says that nope, something weird is going on”.

Panel 5: The ship hovers on top of a platform in what looks like a persian-inspired building. Rowi says “Okay, they have a proper ship parking space, but nothing that suggests they will clean the ship. I’ll warn them that our hull is poisoned, we’ll hover here until they tell us to go down”.
