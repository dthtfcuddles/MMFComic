Panel 1: Narration explains “The trip to the closest space station lasted for around a week”. Sher says “Oooh this must be one of these things Roi told me… what is it called? A screen! Cool”.

Panel 2: Sher is asleep next to his guitar. The narration explains “And knowing I was completely alone and "safe” was a weird feeling. The lack of sound was also jarring. It was absolutely silent".

Panel 3: Sher is in the full darkness with a flashlight. The narration continues. “Since darkness is calming for us, I decided to explore the areas of the ship that had no lights at all using a flashlight I found somewhere, thinking I’d find something soothing or nice. And I…”

Panel 4: Sher is screaming in panic and his flashlight is pointing to the corpse of another bunny who died who knows how long ago. The narration says “… I regretted it almost immediately”.

Panel 5: It shows the ship reaching a space station. The narration explains “That helped me learn that, while Space has no predators like the ones in my home planet, it wasn’t completely safe. I also found other bunny corpses in the dark rooms, so I avoided them for the time being. Finally, the ship arrived at a space station. This was going to be my first actual contact with any kind of alien. Roi had taught me a bit about how to behave, and the translator would make things easier”.
