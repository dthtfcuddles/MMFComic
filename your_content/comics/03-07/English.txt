Panel 1: It shows the pirate ship. “OK, that ship is thrice the size of ours, but our main problem is that it’s armed to the teeth. We have no weapons in ours”.

Panel 2: D has an incredulous expression. “Wait, we’re completely unarmed? Knowing there are pirates out there? Why that?”. Rowi facepalms and apologizes. “Oh god damn it, I’m an idiot! I forgot completely to tell you! I’m so sorry, D, I should’ve told you but I forgot. Often, like in the case of peace missions, we are allowed to enter places ravaged by war. One of the reasons we can do that is because we aren’t bringing weapons of any kind”.

Panel 3: D says “I get it. But what are we gonna do now? We have a little over 1 minute left”. Rpwo says “On it. Cloak turned on, it will activate in 15 seconds. Runaway time! Computer, head forward at full speed right now”. D says “I feel like I should be scared, yet I’m not”. THe narration says “Fights against pirate spaceships aren’t like movies portray them (the pilots controlling the ship dramatically). Instead, they’re more like AI vs AI. We tell the ship what to do, but  the heavy lifting is done by the ship’s AI, including the evasion of incoming fire.

Panel 4: Sher says “I’m not scared either, D, and also I’m honestly surprised we’ve been doing this for 3 or 4 years and this is the first time we’re facing a pirate ship, so much you weren’t even aware we’re unarmed. Rowi replies with “Well, my bonbon filled with coffee, most pirates avoid attacking avali ships because they’re usually well armed and avali pack crews tend to be scary efficient at dispatching enemies. This guy is either a newbie or has nothing left to live for”.

Panel 5: “I admit it’s a bit strange to see you so calm, Sher”. Sher repies “I am calm, indeed. I’m with you, my family, and that’s enough for me. Besides, I choose to trust the tech we have here and the hands guiding our ship”. Rowi replies, embarassed, “Stop it, dear”.
