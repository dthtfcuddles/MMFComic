Panel 1 shows a planet with two moons. “Planet SCR-455, galaxy ASO-72KB8″.

Panel 2 shows two reptilian creatures with antennas. One is bringing a plate. “Your dinner is here, your Majesty”. The king says “Yeah, whatever” while sitting at a desk.

Panel 3 shows the “Majesty” asking “Is it vampire bunny meat?” and the other replies with “No, sir, just regular darani meat. We haven’t been able to catch any bunnies lately”.

Panel 4 shows a rather humble building that looks vaguely like a couple small lighthouses and a barn. The king rants. “Argh! This is so infuriating! Why am I surrounded by incompetents? I can’t even relax and eat my favourite meat because those damn bunnies started hiding and my soldiers, supposedly the best we have, can’t catch a mere 10 or 15 bunnies. The drones we have watching that planet show us that they go out daily to… well, do whatever it is they do when roaming free! How is it possible that nobody can see them!? Argh”.

Panel 5 shows the king handling some papers and talking a lot again. “Anyways, Captain, back to more pressing matters. You’re already aware that Avali have technology far beyond anything we’ll ever be able to have, and as such, they will not bow to us, nor will they surrender. Quite the opposite they would oppose us, and that’s a big problem. I’ve thought hard about this, and it’s time we tackle this, heads on. The idea is to start convincing different species that these turkeys are not to be trusted, that they’re just biding their time to take over the universe with their technology. I made a plan for this. Get it checked for any errors. You know the check protocol. That’s all”.
