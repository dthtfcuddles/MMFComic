Panels 1 and 2 show the trio in a sauna, meditating or focused. Sher looks exhausted and sweaty.

Panel 3 shows Sher getting off the sauna saying “This wasn’t enjoyable at all. I can barely breather and the thing was way too warm”.

Panel 4 shows the trip walking by an aisle, the place still filled with steam. There are a couple photos or paintings in the background. Rowi says “Then you’ll enjoy the next part: Now we take a quick icy shower and then we’ll be done”. Sher stopped to see one of the photos, saying “huh?”.

Panel 5 shows Xunkiira hugging an old human grandma. Sher says “Who’s that human?”.
