Panel 1: The car is parked. Its fully night and dark. Sher says "After living on 32 hour days for a while, it feels weird to be in a place where days are just 22 long". D replies "that's one of the perks of living in space".

Panel 2 shows a map. Rowi says, pointing at it "Based off the terrain map we have, there are two good potential options. We'll go to the closest one... and nap for a few hours". Sher replies "Okay".

Panel 3 shows the sky, with two moons. "See you later, when the sun rises".

The final panel shows the same two moons over the dark forest trees. Rowi asks "...What's on your mind, my dear dumpling?". Sher says "Many things. But mainly that I'm... still in awe over sll this. I've been so lucky with everything, with meeting you, your pack and now... that I'm trying to save my entire species. My wishes have been coming true, one by one. As a kid, i was taught that the protector of the balance, our god, is always keeping an eye on us. I know my people can be a bit supersticious, but I keep thinking that maybe, only maybe, there's some truth to it."
