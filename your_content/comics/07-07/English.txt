Panel 1: Sher’s parents hug in terror. Sawi is hugging them softly. Eikomi asks, frowning, “Do you hear it, sis?” and Sawi replies “Very drowned by the guitar, but yes”. Nau says “These screams, Khi, this is what our moms told us they saw when they were our age!”

Panel 2: Sher is still screaming “Born to fucking die” while playing the guitar. Behind him there are words saying “It hurts! Help! Please! Forgive us! Aaahhh! It hurts! Mommy! We’ll do anything!, Please, let us go!” and so. The narration explains. “Sher had recorded a sample of himself screaming in his mother language, begging for help and stating pain and terror. That sample (creepily distorted) was being played along with the song. For his family this was, basically, a reminder of the years they begged horkers to spare their lives without success”.

Panel 3: Everything is dark except for spots of light from the audience. The narration says “The song ended in an extremely long held note while the sample kept repeating again and again. Once the sample had faded into silence, it felt like listening to something from Sunn O))). The lights also went off for a minute, then all we heard were the mumbles of the audience. It’s incredibly hard to put in words what it felt being here. This track surprised everyone who had come to listen to our cheery "radio metal” style, being a song way gloomier and scarier than any of the other ones we had played. Anyways…“

Panel 4: It shows Sher hugging his parents in the darkness. The narration continues. ”… after a family moment in absolute darkness (that was intentional; for vampire bunnies being in the darkness is soothing and calming), my fluffy snowball returned to the stage".

Panel 5: Shows sher, with an angry expression, singing the followup song. “♪ This bloody road remains a mystery. The sudden darkness fills the air. What are we waiting for? Won’t anybody help us? What are we waiting for?”.
