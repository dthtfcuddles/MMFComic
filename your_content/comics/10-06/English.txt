Panel 1 shows an Unmizu greeting the band. "Welcome to Cytak City. I'm sure my counterpart on the surface already greeted you. I've been directly appointed by our King to be your official guide while you're here".

Panel 2 shows the band. D is holding a tablet that looks like a phone, and they say "OK, I'm keeping a photo of this". Sher says "Pretty! So many beautiful colors! Wow!". Rowi, wearing his large summer hat says "You have better vision than me, so I trust your judgement".

Panel 3 is a large panel that shows a city where every roof is made of a gem, there are some water flowing and plants all around. On top there's a large dome made of glass, and outside of the dome it can be seen that the city is deep underwater. All the gems are sparkly. D says "This is pretty! Are those roofs made of gemstones?" and the Unmizu says "Yes! And the dome covering the city is made of a special kind of crystal that is strong enough to resist even a barrage of nukes".
