Panel 1 shows the ship taking speed. Panel 2 the ship just disappeared. The AI says “Warp succesful”.

Panel 3 shows Sher glomping Rowi’s side, while Rowi points up in a hero pose. D claps his hands behind them. Sher says “You did it! You did it! You’re awesome! You saved us!”. Rowi says “We did it! We escaped from that mofo! Granted, it was because he was a fucking noob that couldn’t even take over a completely unarmed ship, but still, woohoo!”.

Panel 4 shows Rowi yawning. “Sadly, our small escape experience did indeed consume a lot of fuel. In addition we gotta clean the ship from all the shit it may have gotten stuck to it when we were inside the atmosphere of that planet. I’ll tell the ship to go to the closest friendly planet, then I’ll head to bed”.

Panel 5 shows a planet with a moon. The description says “RBO-49382199, Also known as Bluey. This planet is inhabited by humans; in the 330BC an alien race kidnapped some humans from Earth expecting to use them as slaves here. However, humans rebelled and destroyed their captors. Today they’re not hostile towards aliens, but they aren’t interested in space politics either”.
