Panel 1: Sawi, Sher, Naha, Rowi, D, Eikomi, Nau and Khi are walking together by what looks like Warfaisser’s mall; there’s a flying drone holding a box with clothes. Sawi says “Do you see anything you wanna buy, cherry?” and Sher replies “Not really, I have everything I could ever want”. Rowi says “Are you aware we could make similar clothes with a nano-loom, eiky?” and Eikomi replies “Of course I do, but where’s the fun in that?

Panel 2: D is checking out a comic along with Eikomi at a comic store. The seller says "This series was drawn in Kawabari, and it was inspired by Earth’s comics. I have all 30 chapters”. D says “The artstyle is beautiful, and the art quality is amazing! Yes, I’ll buy the whole series. 30 comics is 6000 credits [around $600 USD], right?”

Panel 3: Roi is testing a poncho. She says “How do I look, meky goo?”. Mekari, who’s standing on a lower floor but whose head is at Roi’s level due to his size, says “Not bad, but I’m not sure the pattern fits”. Roi says “fair”.

Panel 4: There’s a view of the space station ans a light exiting from it. The narration says “After some days our time at Warfaisser Station was over. We set off in the direction of Sher’s planet to escort his parents home safely”.
