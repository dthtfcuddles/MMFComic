Russet: The fact Mekari is on the FLOOR BELOW to have a conversation with Roi and is still taller the her is just fantastic! Also yeah Roi the stripes do not work!
htf: This is even more insane when you remember that -technically speaking- Sleriki are blind, they can only see heat. I wonder if he can see the stripes due to the "heat" of each color or something like that.
