Panel 1: Eikomi is on a messaging app. She says “Hi! Rowi! Cherry! Cutie! This is a small message to tell you we got an invitation to some “Ultra Music Festival”. It says that you will perform in it, so we’re invited for free.”

Panel 2: Eikomi looks to a side and continues. “I asked them why did they contact us instead of you… they said that for a lot of artists, being in a festival like that is the highest point of their careers, so they invite the families of the performers so they can be part of that moment too.”

Panel 3: She continues: “Anyways, the thing is, as a pack we decided that we haven’t had proper vacations for years so… Wait, I forgot your computer has 3D hologram capabilities. That means I can do this…”

Panel 4: Eikomi looks like she’s coming out of the laptop, touching Rowi’s face. “We as a pack decided to take a month long vacation and come watch your show! See you later, little brother!”.

Panel 5 just shows Rowi using his laptop with a dark background, with him saying “…”.

Panel 6 shows the spaceship, and Rowi saying “Thank you guys, we’ll be happy seeing you there. Please, take care and see you in 2 months, then! I love you”.
