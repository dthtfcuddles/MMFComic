Panel 1: Everyone is drinking juice. Mekari, standing next to the trio (who are sitting down) asks “Hey friends? Is it true that we’ll travel to the Avali homeland? I forgot the name. Apologies for it”. Rowi says “Yup”.

Panel 2: Sher is drinking orange juice with his eyes closed. Meanwhile Rowi continues. “We’re going mainly to buy a new bass guitar for D. Why the question?”. Mekari replies “To be honest, I don’t have a true real reason, but I know that you have technology that’s the envy of a lot of species… Well, I’d like to buy one of these visors you have, but I don’t even know if they’d even sell me one”.

Panel 3: Sher says “Don’t worry, I’ll get you one once we’e there. I was thinking you may need one during the concert to be aware of all the stuff going on anyways”.

Panel 4: Rowi says “Your fur shows you’re still seething. Am I right?”. Sher replies “mhm. I mean… you saw. it. This is intense for me. Until just a couple days I had managed to put Horkers in the back of my mind. But.. no, they returned in full swing. But… unlike other vampire bunnies, I got you. I got not just a new family, but also the chance to tell the universe about what happened, not only to my species but also to the mullous’. I want to let our history be known. Am I too selfish for… just.. wanting to set that as my goal… dragging you along with it?”.

In the panel 5 we see D drinking spezi with an approval expression, while in the background they hear “supportive chirp sounds” and “happy sounding squeaks”.
