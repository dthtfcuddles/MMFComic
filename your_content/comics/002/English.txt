Panel 1 shows the band (bunny, avali and deer) together. The deer is holding a bass guitar, and is wearing spiky bands on their antlers. The avali is wearing a beanie and has both hands softly on the bunny’s head. The bunny is greeting with one hand (that is very fluffy and has paw pads), with the other hand being at the height of their chest fluff. The bunny says “See you next time, you cute people!”.

Panel 2 shows the band eating at some restaurant. The avali says “People reacted positively to our new song”, and the deer replies with “mhm”. The Avali keeps scratching the bunny’s head softly. The bunny has a joy expression.

Panel 3 shows both the Avali and the bunny. The avali has a plate of meatballs with fries, the bunny has mashed potatoes with fries. The bunny says, while looking down, “I was scared. If I’m honest, I just wanted to throw everything and run away…”

Panel 4 is identical to panel 3, but the avali is now petting his friend. The bunny looks at the camera with a happy expression. “… but you were with me, so everything was okay!”.

Panel 5 shows the deer leaving, and giving a last look to their friends. The deer says “I’m always amazed at how when you perform nobody notices your heavy stage fright. Anyways, I’m off. I’ll go back to our ship. See you later”. At a side there’s a small descriptive square. “Name: D. Species: Deer. Age: 25. Likes: Anime. Dislikes: Being around people in general”.
