Panel 1: Auz’uls says “Not gonna kill me? That’s… What’s happening?” and MX-110 replies with “Your rescue is here”. Both are walking through some dark corridor in a cave.

Panel 2: Auz’uls says “My… rescue? W…what do you mean? What the fuck?”.

Panerl 3: MX-110 replies with “Don’t play dumb, meatbag. We know since long ago. We were told. And when the music band arrived, we just confirmed what we already knew. It’s almost funny how organic species think that since we’re robots, that we can’t pick up gestures, poses, suspicious acting, etc. and plan ahead. Just thank whatever deity you worship, because you’re being set free now.

Panel 4: Both are going upstairs but through the same corridor. Auz’uls says “B… but… if you knew, why did you jail me? Why did you threaten with killing me all the time? Why…?”. MX-110 replies with “You’re not a threat, and we have a diplomatic focus for our operation. I cannot give you more information.

Panel 5: They’re at the same balcony that the band landed in chapter 3. There’s a small personal Avali vessel with thrusters on the back. MX-110 says “Now get out and never come back. The next time you’ll be targeted as an enemy”. Auz’uls replies with “I… I… ok, I don’t get it. Nothing of this makes sense. But ok, I’ll leave! You’ll never see me again!”.

Panel 6: Auz’uls is in the ship, sitting down at the pilot chair. He’s looking at the panel in front of her, saying “OK, let’s see… this is all in Avali core… set course, OK, done. I should reach the closest space station in 6 months. Good for me. There’s also a stasis system. OK. Let’s go. This is so strange. Why did I get an avali vessel for free? Why was I set free? I… I am going to stop questioning or my head will blow up.
