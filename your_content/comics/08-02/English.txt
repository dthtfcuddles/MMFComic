Panel 1: The band still plays. This time, though, D is playing a harmonica while Sher says “Thank you very much for coming! We love you! You’re awesome and we hope to see you again! Stay safe and take fucking care! Good fucking night!”

Panel 2: Sher hands his guitar to D while saying “I need to go quickly to the restroom. Could you hold this for me?” and D replies with “Sure”.

Panel 3: Both Roi and Mekari look at a side. Out of the frame someone is saying “Woah! Woah! Amazing! This was such a good show! Well done!”.

Panel 4: Shows Rowi, D and Mekari taking off their instruments. Some furry with mouse-like ears, long neck and a tail sock says “That was a performance for all the ages! I couldn’t have done it better myself! Ha ha ha”. Roi says “Sir, you’re too close, and I can also smell you do not have the best intentions. Please stay back”. D says “hm… I smell Schnapps, actually”. Rowi says “uhm… thank you? Who are you?”.
