Panel 1 shows the ship flying at warp speeds. so fast that the stars look like rain drops with light. "Heading to Protion now. Our cruise speed is the maximum this ship can deliver... Around 8 times the speed of light". Sher is saying "Uugghhh we should be going to Babupekkakerok instead".

Panel 2 shows Sher with his fur extremely rough. He says "The rumors were true after all, Horkers going to our planet to kidnap bunnies... and he's going to claim our planet for himself? Fucking cockalorum!".

Panel 3 Shows Rowi hugging Sher, with Mekari, Roi and D being there too. Rowi says "Your fur shows very clearly that this is the angriest you've been in your entire life, and I get it. I can't even begin to imagine how you're feeling right now. But we can't do this on our own. If we try, we'll just be shot by some horker and that will be the end of us". Roi adds "...and the rest of us bunnies too". D says "Sher, my brother, I want to tell you something about all this, but we need to sit down at the table with food. Let's do that. The ship is already going as fast as it can".

Panel 4 shows D on the table, eating mashed potatoes with something that resemble burgers, but dry. D says "The horker king has been doing a lot of horrible things, yet it seems like the Space Coalitions respect him. And why is that? He could be just a conqueror that rules with fear, but these coalitions would just shut him down. Well, my friends, just two letters: P.R.".

The last panel shows D talking. "That bastard is boosting his public image while doing all that horrible shit under the table. Helping the Kuyorui? Being nice in public? It's just to boost his image and look like a good, helpful nice leader. We cannot take that down on our own. We NEED help... and it happens that we can get that help. Isn't Rowi's pack in contact with the leaders of the Illuminate? That help is going to be invaluable".
