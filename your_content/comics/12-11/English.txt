Panel 1 shows the Elder vampire bunny from the Tauerk tribe along with other bunnies next to her, and Sher. She says "We do believe you. The four ear friends from space came here as well, however, right now we're facing some urgent matters, and until these get resolved, we want to stay out of anything else".

Panel 2 shows plants, including some white flowers. "When we settled up here, the white plants here were a thing. But as the years went by, more and more plants went white, losing their flavor and making us sick".

Panel 3 shows more white plants and a foraging party. "Since we do have some stored food, we decided to send some of our foraging parties to scout for places to move to". Sher says "Got it, ma'am. We'll help you with that".

Panel 4 shows D and Sher sitting in their vehicle, with D saying "You know we can and will help you in every way we can, but don't forget we're running against a ticking clock". Sher replies "I am well aware, but the more we help, the more other tribes will know we're here to be helpful".

The last panel shows Rowi driving the vehicle while Sher keeps talking. "We bunnies are all about cooperating with each other, but I don't know every single tribe, and in the end, I want to show them that I can help them as a diplomat". D replies with "Fair".
