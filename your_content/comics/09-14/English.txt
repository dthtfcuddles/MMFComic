Panel 1: Two announcers pandering to stereotypical skater teens talk: “The next band is a small band from Cerro Alegre. Please welcome Talirubi and his Gang!”.

Panel 2: Talirubi says “Hello Reñaca! Me and my band are gonna give you an awesome show!”. Sher narrates “Our gig was a small 20 minute show at a free concert in Reñaca, celebrating summer”.

Panel 3: Sher narrates “By now I was used to busking, but now instead of 5-15 people there were a hundred at least. That made me nervous and I committed a couple mistakes”.

Panel 4. “After a couple minutes I regained control and I did my work correctly. Overcoming that stage fright was a huge thing for me”.

Panel 5: The band is drinking juice at some restaurant. Sher says “When the concert ended I was over the moon. So much, that I dared to talk when we were getting off stage”.

Panel 6: Sher says at the mic “Thank you for having us! Have a great day!”.
