Panel 1: It shows two spaceships soaring through the galaxy. Someone says "Uh... my lord... uh... why did we leave the bunny planet? We had more than enough to take over and they couldn't do anything!". The Horker King replies "Okay, I'm not going to yell at you this time because your question isn't an incompetent one".

Panel 2 shows the Horker King in front of what looks like a flag with Horker writing. "I wanted that planet. Not only the meat of these bunnies is unique and delicious, but that planet would work perfectly as a hub to start acting on this side of the universe. Hell, there's even a place to add an intergalactic teleporter a couple planets away, if we can convince the Kasvane species to do so".

Panel 3 shows the king looking at a photo of Ck'akk with Horker text around. He continues. "... However, they're now allies of the Avali, the one species that has the technology, the strength and the resolve to take us down. I have a plan to get rid of them... and that plan has been in development for almost 20 years. I'm not going to risk it.

Panel 4 shows him talking to one of his aides. "Right now we need all the good PR wer can get, even if that means looking weak for ahile, or letting go of a few things. I'm here for the long run".

Panel 5 he continues. "I'm not going to insist with this planet, even if I suspect that what that Avali did was against their own rules. I can always reconquer it after my plan is done". The aide says "I get it now! You're so awesome my lord!" and the king replies "Why do I feel like you didn't understand a word I just said? It's like talking to a brick wall".
