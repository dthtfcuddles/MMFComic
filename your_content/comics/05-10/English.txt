Panel 1: Rowi, Sher and D are sitting in a sofa, while the alien (that now can be seen as a bug lady) is sitting on a pillow, in what looks like the back entrance of a house. Rowi says “Sher, D, let me introduce you to Xunkiira. She’s a scientist friend of mine since before I even visited Earth. She has the ability to read minds and communicate with anything. Kiira, they’re my friends. Or better said, my family”. Xunkiira replies with “I’m happy to meeting you all. I sensed no ill will between you as soon as you arrived, so I could tell you’re good friends. Make of this place your home, you can unwind for some days and then resume your duties about your incoming concert”.

Panel 2: D looks to a side and says “Um… ma’am… Could I ask you… to… uh… not to read my mind about… my… um.. you know… my family on Earth?”.

Panel 3: Xunkiira replies with “Dearie, unfortunately i can’t isolate areas of your mind. However, I knew that these thoughts hurt you, so i was going to ignore them. But also I cannot hear you talking. I have no auditory system. That means that for talking i have to read your mind”.

Panel 4: The camera is located slightly behind Sher, showing basically Rowi’s hand rubbing his head. Sher says “Wait. Does that mean that you know what I’m upset about already…? And that you know about my species and family and all that?”. The bug lady replies with “Yup, and lemme tell you, you aren’t the only one super upset. Anyways, enjoy your stay!”

Panel 5: We see Rowi scratching Sher’s head with both hands; the bunny has his eyes closed. Meanwhile D looks a bit uncomfortable. Rowi says “Thank you, Kiira” and Xunkiira replies with “No need to say it~”.
