Chapter complete.

This was one of the most interesting chapters I’ve done of this comic, and one of the ones I enjoyed making the most. There are many things that were set up here, from giving Sher’s parents proper depth and importance, to set up the scenario for a lot of the plots to come in a future.
Chapter 8 will take a while to make, and I expect it to come out during November. However, I’ll try to post something cute in September 17th to celebrate this comic’s first anniversary! Woohoo!
I want to thank everyone who has read this and shared it around and liked it and all that sort of stuff. You’re awesome. And I hope things get even better from now on!
Talk to you later!

Russet: So this was the first full chapter I helped on with pacing and ideas and words. I also discovered Victor is not allowed to use the word In or On without supervision. In Spanish they are the same word "en" so untangling the weird arse context behind which one to use in English is baffling for a non-native speaker.
Heck it is baffling for a native speaker at times, you just sort of have to... read the sentence and I instinctively know if it is "On a planet" or "In a planet" but I couldn't explain WHY not properly.

htf: Hey it's not my fault that english people must figure out that being in the fridge is not the same that being on the fridge or being at the fridge but then you can be at the apartment, in the apartment on the apartment complex. AAAHHHHH
