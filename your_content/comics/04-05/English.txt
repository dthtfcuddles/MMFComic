Panel 1 shows Naha hugging Sher. He says "Sher!!! Aaah! Missed you, little brother! How are you? How have you been?". Sher replies "Nahaaaa you have no idea how much I wanted to see you again!".

Panel 2 Naha is handshaking D's hand. He says "Nice to meet you, D! Rowi and Sher kept saying only good thingd about you the last time they came". D replies "Nice to meet you too!".

Panel 3 shows Rowi and Naha with the feathers all poofed up staring at each other, both with frowny expressions and a threatening pose, screaming at the same time "AAAAAAAA" and "EEEEEEEE".

Panel 4 D says "Rowi definitely looks happier than usual". Sher says "Packs and brotherhood are incredibly important for Avalis. It doesn't surprise me. It was the same the last time I came here".

Panel 5 the group is walking. Naha says "Our work as a pack consists of finding good sources of minerals that can be of interest for the whole Avali civilization (for example, minerals used in the fabrication of nano-machines), going there, assessing the costs and risks of getting it, and actually overseeing the mining job, being sure that the quality is as good as the Illuminate (our leaders) expect". Rowi says "Our job is a high-rank one, and we outrank most other packs when it comes to it". Naha continues. "Rowi's work is one of the least time consuming ones, but also one of the most important ones that also requires some very particular knowledge: He usually scouts planets, either going there or using our computers and hardware, assess the place and runs the first round of checks to be sure the work is not going to be a waste of resource, time... and possibly even lives. His work is the base for everyone else's. That's also why he doesn't have to be here all the time and why he can spend most of the time with you, guys. He does return once a year, to do anything we may need him to, though, and if we don't, he will help with anything else we may need."
