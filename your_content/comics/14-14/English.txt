Panel 1: Narration says "Later...". The panel shows one of the new dome houses. Sher says "Wait, what!? Warfaisser? For real?". Sawi replies "Yes. So you have two very large gigs coming".

Panel 2 shows Rowi and Sher looking at their tablets. Rowi says "Things are identical to 3 years ago, even the allocated time". Sher says "Yes, but... you know, I want to focus on the next concert here first, and only then focus on this".

Panel 3 Sawi says "I knew you'd say that, cherry, and I have good news about this. The stage is being built, we'll go see it tomorrow if it stops snowing, and... among the uplifting packs coming, there's two professional sound engineering packs that will help you with the next show.".

Panel 4 shows Sawi pointing up. "Also, this is the last show without actual band roadies. Mekari is already interviewing candidates".

Panel 5 shows snow getting more intense. Sher says "... I don't think snow will stop the next 3 days". Sawi asks "How do you know that, cherry?" and Sher replies "I... I can't explain it. We bunnies just... know. Most of the time".
