Panel 1: It shows Roi and her party, along with Mekari. they're planning their next foraging expedition, and Mekari is saying he can trample any danger plants safely due to his enormous size. The narration says "We spent a little over one month visiting bunny tribes, and Sher was accepted as a diplomat by every single one. After that, we decided to rest, living among Sher's tribe for now. Everyone got ingrained in that bunny lifestyle".

Panel 2 shows D playing the bass and singing "Through Glass" to Sher's little brother who's asleep against their chest.

Panel 3: Sher is studying about being a diplomat.

And in Panel 4 Rowi is talking with Khi. Sher's father tells him "Rowi-Friend, there's a very serious thing I want to talk to you about, but I don't want anyone else to hear this just yet. Follow me.".

Last panel has Khi saying "When the previous four-ear friend pack came to study us, they changed something. Every foraging party (and not just from our village) have been reporting that there's fewer predators in general. This should be happy news, but we're worried. If we get careless, we could still be hunted and die. That's why we haven't said it publicly yet... But we know foraging parties talk. We want to stay safe, but this cannot be a secret for much longer. I know your species know diplomacy; I've seen Sher studying from your species' knowledge. How should we tackle this?".
