Panel 1: Mekari says, while Rowi and Sher look at each other, “Yes, exactly. Now, I know we don’t have too much money in general, but we can put together all we have and anything else we can provide, and…”

Panel 2: Rowi interrupts him. “Dude, you don’t need to offer us stuff. The answer is yes. We aren’t here for the money… well, a little. But it isn’t our main motivation”. Sher says “Just give us enough to cover the cost of coming, some groceries and that’s about it”.

Panel 3: It shows the band performing at some underground cave with glowy mushrooms. Sher is singing “♪ I’ve been through planets / I’ve visited asteroids / I’ve been to hostile worlds / And I’m proud of what I am! / If you don’t like it / You can go fuck yourself! ♪”
