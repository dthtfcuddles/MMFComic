Panel 1: A space station that looks like a normal Earth vessel but with bug legs and a panel solar at the “tail”. A narration dialog says “Souleye Station, Galaxy RH66530B48, around 25 million light years away from Avalon”. Someone says “I hope you’re having a good time! Our next song is from our second album and it’s called “Dirty hell”!”

Panel 2: Sher plays the guitar and next to him D is standing with a bass that has a completely different design to the one they use normally, with a romboid shape and the aerogel terminations so common in Avali gear. The bass’s neck is long and the headstock looks like the feathers of the avali logo. The bass also sports 5 strings, not 4. Behind them there’s Rowi’s drumkit but he can’t be seen due to the angle. Sher sings “Yeeaaahh! Your trash! The floor! Stop! You filthy pig! Keep it clean! Your town! Your world”.

Panel 3: Sher keeps singing “Bring destruction to your land tossing shit to the ground!”. The panel shows Rowi playing the drumkit, with his face covered in a face paint that gives him a more “beast” appearance.

Panel 4: We see Sher’s face with an angry expression, while playing the guitar. “Fuck you! Your planet’s worth you lower! Fuck you! Your fucking shit and garbage!”.

Panel 5: It’s a wide panel where we can see they’re playing at a space station. There’s a good amount of audience (at least 45 people, but more hidden behind others), all of them aliens of different kinds except for three humans. Sher says “Take care of your planets! Don’t toss your trash to the floor unless it’s biodegradable! Don’t do what some people at some places we’ve been do! Yeah!”.
