Finally, chapter 10 is done! This chapter was special in the sense we’re starting a new arc, and we have big plans for it. I hope you liked it! The next chapter should (hopefully) come out in October or November.

Working on this was fun because not only we had to come up with lore for more species (the Unmizu are a species I had created some years ago but without lore) but also because we finally could start showing the Horker king. So far most of the info about horkers had been talked about, not shown, and finally we can move on to the “show them” phase.

That’s all about Chapter 10! Immense thanks to my co-writer Russet for helping with this. The next chapters will also tie the story properly with the <a href="/MMFComic/voyages/">Voyages of the Odyssey</a>. And yes, the “second season” is being written, but we don’t expect to have it done anytime soon. Or at least not before chapter 12, I think.

Now, for the future: On the technical side of things, there are chances (not decided yet) that the next chapters will switch away from the toning effect; not only because I have been growing to not to like it as much (it looks bad at some screen resolutions) but because I’ll be switching tools. I usually use Clip Studio Paint for the pages, but I’m trying Krita. It won’t be a “sudden change”- the next chapter will be made with both tools- but I need to adapt, and the toning tools arent as well developed or easy to find. But we will see how it goes. What I mean is that the next chapter will change “coloring” styles; my goal is to keep the manga-styled look but making it look better.

That’s about it for now! See you!
