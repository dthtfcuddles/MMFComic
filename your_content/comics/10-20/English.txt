The page is just a large panel showing a very roughed vampire bunny that's smoking a cigar. He says "I'm going to be direct. There isn't a lot of time and I'm not willing to wait more than we already have. I'll repeat my captain's words. Behave and you'll come back unharmed. Are you coming with us peacefully or are you going to give us grief?". Then he asks in vampire bunny song "What do you decide?". There's a "To be continued" at the bottom right corner of the panel.
