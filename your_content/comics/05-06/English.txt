Panels 1 and 2: Rowi is playing a very fast and angry rhythm, with airs to “painkiller” from Judas Priest. He’s not using his usual e-drumkit but a traditional acoustic drumkit.

Panel 3: Rowi finishes that drumming, exhausted and resting his body against the drumkit itself. A narration rectangle says that he’s been blasting like this for 3 hours already. Rowi is panting and murmuring “Mother fuckers”.

Panel 4: Sher enters to the room and says “Hey sweetheart… uhm… I dont think this is the most comfy way of playing drums. Hey, I hadn’t seen you using your acoustic kit since… 2013?”. Rowi just keeps panting and saying “damn”.

Panel 5: D comes and says “Rowi, Sher, we need to talk. It’s rather important. Let’s come to the dinner room”.
