Panel 1: Sher is at the entrance of a restaurant, with the signs saying in Standard Galactic Alphabet “Teshari (word cut)”. He thinks “Apparently this is the place”.

Panel 2: An alien that resembles vaguely an avali but with 6 ears, antenna, four arms and a more reptile-like tail is saying “Sher Böhnchen! Welcome to the Teshari Restaurant. Yes, your family is waiting for you. Follow me”.

Panel 3: It’s a wide panel; both the alien and Sher are walking down what looks like stepless stairs, and the whole family is there having dinner. Roi says “Brother! I knew it was you! I could tell by your scent!”. Sawi says “Cherry! Welcome!” and Rowi says “Hey, my apple crumble, darling! Come here!”. The alien says “Here’s your other family member! If you need anything, don’t hesitate to call us!”

Panel 4: Eikomi is being hugged by D with one arm, and she’s resting her head against his shoulder. D (who mysteriously is lacking his antlers) is holding his tablet with the other hand. Eikomi says “What’s up D-R? I see you receiving lots of messages, not replying to any… yet still staring at your screen nonstop. You didn’t even flinch when your antlers fell down”. D replies “It’s fine, they’ll grow back again in a couple weeks. It’s just… how to put it?”

Panel 5 shows a phone conversation. D says “Let’s say I’m not going anywhere alone, at least for a few days”. Rowi says “Wait, D, what’s going on?”.
