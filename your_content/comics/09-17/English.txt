However…

Panel 1: Rowi, Sher and Juan are walking in front of the sea. Sher says “Juan, I want to thank you for everything. You’ve been a real friend. Rowi and I talked at length. He can’t be coming every week to practice with us. So… we reached a decision”.

Panel 2: D asks “How did he react?” and Rowi says “He told me Sher was a good person and to take care of him”.

Panel 3: Juan gives the hand to Sher. “It was a pleasure to meet you, Sher. Thank you for making this experience fun. I wish you much luck from now on”. Sher replies “Thank you Juan. I wish the same for you”.

Panel 4: Shows Sher and Rowi saying goodbye. The narration says “And… that’s the story of how I came to Earth and met Rowi. Of course, there’s also how we met D, but that is a story for another time”.

Panel 5: Shows the trio teleporting back to the ship. Sher says “Hey dear? Before leaving the country, I want to go somewhere else first”. Rowi replies “Of course! Anywhere you want”.
