Panel 1 says “the next morning…”. It has Rowi sitting at his drumkit. Sher tells him “I’ll show you what I came up with, you can compose the drum line afterwards”. Rowi says “Okay”.

The next two panels have Sher trying to sing something (”From the time I camer here I didn’t know where I was from”.

Panel 4 has Sher taking out the page from his paper notebook while saying angrily “Argh! I can’t do this! This is so frustrating!”.

Panel 5 Sher hits his head against the wall, saying “This is hopeless. I can’t do it. I don’t have what it takes. I’m so frustrated that I just want to say bad things about myself, horrible things that I feel right now but that I know aren’t true”.
