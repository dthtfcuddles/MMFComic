Panel 1: The scrawny bunny pirate says, holding the cigar he was smoking. "Listen to me. The horkers, right now, are focused on taking over Wakkr'y, but their next goal is Babupekkakerok, our bunny home planet, to take it back. I *really* don't want that to happen. Sher Ouakkia, you're a superstar and have good friends very high in the Avali hierarchy. You can get bunnies the help we didn't get a century ago".

Panel 2 has Sher saying "WHAT".

Panels 3 and 4 have the pirate explaining. "A century ago, Horkers came to our planet, decimated our species and left us on the verge of extinction after killing us and then trafficking our meat, while keeping the fact we were a sapient species hidden from everyone else. But they didn't leave. Not completely, at least. They kept coming back to our home, kidnapping some of us as a 'test' or a 'treat' for their king every so often. And you, Sher Ouakkia, becoming famous and calling them out have put pressure on them. The more known you are, the more they feel the need to go back to our home, not to get more 'samples' or 'treats', but to take back our entire Planet for themselves, like they've considered it to be for 100 years".

Panel 5 has Rowi saying "Okay, assuming what you're saying is true, why go through this 'kidnapping' thing? Why not tell us right there when you had us?". Someone says "Oh, I can answer that, Rowi Ouakkia".

Panel 6 has a crazy looking Avali. "Protocol Vermilion AK-19, Avali Corps: Any Avali, or Avali ally willingly and of their own volition, supporting, giving help or aiding pirates, will be punished according to the protocols defined in the orange statue AH-36... that includes, depending on the severity of the case, demotion, jail time or, in the case of being an active army soldier, execution. Nice to meet you, I'm K'akkz, at your service".
