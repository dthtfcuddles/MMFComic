Hello everyone! Some info about chapter 10.
Like has been happening for several chapters, stuff is going behind curtains. A new arc is starting and its gonna be a fun one; Russet and I have been planning it thoroughly and we hope you’ll like it.
One thing I’m trying, in addition to working on other work and commissions and the such, is to raise the overall quality of the panels and pages. I wanna believe it’s been noticeable in the last chapter too xD
And regarding changing old pages’ panels to fit Sher’s new design and updating minor details (like song lyrics and stuff), it’s done completely with chapters 1, 2, 3 and 9 (Chapter 9 was drawn from the beginning like that). I’ll do it eventually with chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.
That’s it for now. Remember, if you like this comic, share it with your friends!
See you all!

Russet: This is the best chapter cover, for mysterious reasons that are not at all related to MEKARI <3
Also believe it or not I went and made my fursona a Sleriki… I've always been a shapeshifter and now I am a sci-fi space slime who turns into other things! Sleriki are cool

htf: >w< I'm honored
