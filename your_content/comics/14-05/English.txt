Panel 1: D says "I'm sorry, Eiky. It's hard to convey all the nuances on things without having to explain how Earth society works". Eikomi replies "Oh, don't worry about it. I've studied human society in depth since we met. I get it".

Panel 2 Eikomi says "At first I was confused, when we gave you gifts you got emotional, apologized for that and left. Then Rowi told me that society on Earth is ruthless, way too different to ours, so I started learning about it. At Warfaisser I knew things, but didn't know how deep your problems were until your father started harassing you".

Panel 3 just shows D's face with the starry sky in the background.

Panel 4 shows Eikomi resting her head on D's lap with a smile.

Panel 5 has Eikomi raising her hand to rub D's cheek softly, saying "For what is worth... you *are* wanted and loved. And not just by Rowi and Sher".
