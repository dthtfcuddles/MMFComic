In panel 1, Sher and Roi are sitting together at the dinner table, Roi has a glass of water. Rowi is sitting down at the other side. Roi says “First, I wanna say I’m super happy for you both. We usually don’t make super deep connections because… well, we often don’t survive for long. But seeing my little brother this happy, and so… mature and well… it fills me with a happiness I don’t think I’ve felt before. Sadly, our parents have a… very close-minded view of space… and I feel it was my fault”.

In panel 2 Roi continues. “My parents are convinced that space is just the home of slavers and invaders and nothing else. I decided to visit… to… travel… to… wait a moment, is that a fridge!?”

In panel 3 Roi is looking at the fridge in shock, saying “Amazing! The last time I saw one was on Earth, 14 years ago! Aaahhh I didn’t think I’d see another one again!”.

In panel 4, Roi shakes her head and says “No, Roi! Focus! Focus now!”.

In panel 5 she’s back at the seat, and she says “I traveled to Earth myself 14 years ago. I was gone for just 1 year, and when I returned our parents got angry with me because I kept talking about how beautiful space was. When Sher left, they… they… they blamed me, and kept saying I had killed him, and that if he ever returned he’d be “changed” like I was. When they saw you together, they… were right”.
