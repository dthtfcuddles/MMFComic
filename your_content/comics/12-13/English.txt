Panel 1 shows the band next to a lake. Sher says "Without seeing the cave yet, I can say this is a very bad choice. Water usually attracts predators. this is why we will always pick undeground lakes instead". Rowi says "I see" in Avali Core, D says "Ach so".

Panel 2 shows Rowi getting into the vehicle again, saying "It's okay, sugar cube, we have another option and... if that opion isn't good we'll look for more. Let's go, we'll be there in 30 minutes".

Panel 3 shows, 20 minutes later, the vehicle HUD indicating something in the grass. Rowi says "Huh? The vehicle is detecting the biological signature of five vampire bunnies in front of us".

The vehicle stops and opens the window, and Sher says "Bunny-friends? Are you there? Show yourselves. We're here to help".

Panel 5 shows grass, and Panel 6 shows 5 bunnies popping from that grass- the same bunnies who were at Sher's Village, the Tauerk Tribe. One says "Heeey! It's Sher! From the Glowstone tribe! And Rowi-Friend! And Dee-Friend! Hi! What are you doing here?" and another bunny says "Okay, party, let's stop hiding, they're friends!".
