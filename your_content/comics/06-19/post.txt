Final page of this chapter. So far this is my most favorite chapter for several reasons, but the main one is because this gave me the perfect excuse to gather the whole family together and being able to showcase their personalities some more.

Like always, I’m going to take a couple months to draw the next chapter, along with other unrelated stuff I’m working on. Chapter 7 should start coming in early September or, if I manage to hurry up, sometime mid August. See you then!
