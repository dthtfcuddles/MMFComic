Panel 1: Later, Roi says “Hey lil brother, do you have a moment? I have something for you”. Sher says “Of course, Roi! Always!”.

Panel 2: Roi is giving Sher a guitar with some palm trees printed on it. She says “This is an Earth thing named "Guitar”. It makes pleasant sounds if you know how to play it". Sher says “Woah! This thing is huge!”.

Panel 3: Narration says “Nobody in the village showed much interest in the stories Roi had to tell but me, so… she invited me to her room (something very rare among bunnies) and started telling me privately how things were on Earth”. Roi says “There’s an immense body of water, so inimaginably enormous that you cannot see where it ends! They call it ‘sea’!”, Sher says “I am trying to imagine it! It’s hard!”.

Panel 4: Sher is trying to play the guitar. He says “hmmm… maybe one string at the time?”. The narration says: “Roi’s stories made me wish to go to Earth myself and see things with my own eyes. I wasn’t very committed to it, though. Honestly, I was kind of okay with how things were now that my big sister was back. However…”

Panel 5: Narration says “Some days later, tragedy struck again”. The panel shows one of the bunnies being kidnapped by one of the predatorial birds, with the other bunnies on the floor or hiding and the fruit spread around. the kidnapped bunny screams “AAAHHH IT HURTS! AAAHHH!”. Roi says “OH NO! RU!” and Kway screams “DON’T STAY QUIET! MOVE! HE GAVE US SOME EXTRA MINUTES OF SAFETY! LET’S GRAB THE FRUIT AND RUN BACK HOME!”. The narration continues. “Resigning, accepting, moving on. This is the bunny way. But after what Roi had told me… I didn’t want to accept it anymore. This just cemented my resolve to go to 'Earth’ myself”.
