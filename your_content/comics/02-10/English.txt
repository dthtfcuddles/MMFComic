Panel 1: Sher and Rowi are sitting down on Sher’s bed. Sher says “My parents seemed very distressed and not very happy to see me again. However, they accepted you and D rather quickly. That surprised me a little. I wonder if they think I’m a bad son. And to be honest, I wouldn’t blame them”.

Panel 2: Sher says “If they’re upset, that’s understandable. You were gone for over a decade. But I don’t think you’re a bad son. You told me many times how all you wanted was to return when you had success, something to make your family proud. And that doesn’t happen in a year or two”.

Panel 3: Sher says “I feel that I overestimated my ability to make them happy. They really dislike space, over all my mom. And I haven’t even talked with my old foraging party yet”. Rowi replies “I don’t blame them for their hostility towards space. Remember, you were treated as slaves and cattle by some alien race. Anyone with a brain would absolutely understand why they may hate space”.

Panel 4: Sher says “But it doesn’t have to be like that! You’re proof that aliens can be sweet and loving and caring”.

Panel 5: Rowi replies to that statement with “Oh no, honey, it will happen again. Your family is doing well by keeping strangers out. As it stands now, your whole species is in grave danger”. Sher says “huh?”.
