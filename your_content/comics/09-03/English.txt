Panel 1: Rowi says “Imagine if you had the cooling ‘gun’ we use in the ship’s kitchen with you”. Sher laughs while D says “'Like threatening someone with a hair dryer”

Panel 2: D says “Speaking of, I’ve always been curious, what did you do for a living when you arrived here?”

Panel 3: Sher says “Actually, I started singing in the streets. I needed to buy food, and I had seen someone doing the same. For some reason, Earthlings loved my voice, but having to perform in public made me ultra uncomfortable”. Meanwhile the panel shows Sher singing “♪ I am a bunny, I am hungry, and I need money, please help me ♪” to a small group of people.

Panel 4: Rowi says “Oh yeah, we talked about this one a few weeks ago. Your stage fright started because your whole life you had to hide and survive. Then suddenly you are in the spotlight, performing to be able to eat. It sent all your instincts into overdrive, screaming 'danger’”. Sher replies “Yep, exactly”.

Panel 5: Sher says “Funny enough, though, busking was an actually good way to make money. I arrived here in early August, and September is an excellent month here due to the influx of tourists that come to celebrate 'Fiestas Patrias’, the chilean independence holiday. I did busking for 8 months, from August until March when the summer was over. Things slowed down then, and I had to find another job”.
