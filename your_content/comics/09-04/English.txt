Panel 1: Sher says “Around this neighborhood is where I got my actual first job. After 8 months busking, I needed to earn money to live through the "Slow months”. And… I was hired quite easily, actually". D says “I’ll be honest, Sher, this tangled mess of cables just in the open scares me a bit”.

Panel 2: Sher continues narrating. “Mr. Rodríguez hired me to work at his restaurant. He promised me a salary that, while low for anyone else, would be stable and constant. I also got to keep any tips given by the customers. He asked me if I knew how to cook. I didn’t, but I had learned a lot about the human world by then, so he still took me and taught me the basics. After laying some ground rules, I started working for him”.

Panel 3: Sher continues. “Not gonna lie, this job was actually very enjoyable for me. In addition to the money and what I was learning, I had a place to sleep and I could eat freely (within reason).”

Panel 4: Sher has a tray on his head, the tray having a glass, a bottle and a plate. Sher says “1 pastel de choclo with sugar and 1 diet coke. Enjoy your lunch, sir! Made with love”. The client says “Thank you, talking plush!”

Panel 5: Sher is delivering…“One chorrillana for table number 3~”. He narrates. “My working situation was actually amazing! I had food, a roof above me. I already talked about the pay, and in addition to that, the restaurant usually didn’t have many clients at the same time so I wasn’t constantly stressed out. In addition, it seemed like people actually enjoyed being served by a "living plush”, like some used to call me".
