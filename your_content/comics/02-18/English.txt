In panels 1 and 2 Sher is practicing with Rowi’s drumkit and his own guitar. In panel 3 Rowi appears and says “Trying to compose a song from scratch? Do you need some help?”. Sher replies with “Hey dear, if you’re okay with it, yes, please”.

Panel 4 shows Rowi rubbing his cheek against Sher’s, while saying “Of course I am, my peach flavored sour gummi. The next time just ask me, we’re here to support each other after all!”. Sher says “I will! I just didn’t want to take your time”.

Panel 5 shows Rowi hitting one of the rides of his kit from outside. Sher says “Gimme a simple constant beat, I’ll wing it from there. Do you want to sit down here?”.
