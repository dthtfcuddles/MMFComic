Chapter 2 is complete.

To be honest, I hadn’t made a “website” for this comic before because I feared, like it happened with many other projects, that I’d lose steam and it would end in nothing, in addition to the fact that this comic is, in a lot of ways, a platform to practice and improve. But all I can say is that this comic is going to continue. This project has motivated me immensely not only to improve my art but also to recover the love for such a marvelous profession.

This will be the last update for a bit. When chapter 3 is done I’ll start posting it one page a day, like I did with this one.

Thank you very much for reading this.


See you when Chapter 3 begins!

Also, as a fun bit of trivia: November 12nd is Rowi’s birthday! Yes, I created him exactly one year ago, and that was the seed that set up all this comic in motion. Some other day I’ll tell the whole story, including how this started just as vrchat characters.
