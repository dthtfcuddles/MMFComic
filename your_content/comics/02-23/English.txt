Panel 1 shows the ship taking off.

Panel 2 shows Sher eating a sandwich. Rowi hugs him from behind and asks him “How are you feeling, my bucket of chocolate pudding?”.

Panel 3: Sher replies “If I’m fully honest, I wasn’t scared for my safety. I was just afraid of the huge disappointment that I would be giving to my mom and my dad, having been 13 years out… for what? But things turned well. My parents reacted way better than I feared, and in addition you had a glimpse to how our society and customs are. I admit that it saddens me that I couldn’t give you as much as you’ve given to me, but that’s the curse of coming from an undeveloped society… It’s fine, though”.

Panel 4 shows D with a smile, resting on his bed. Sher continues. “Even D, who has said many times how much they hate people, looked happy interacting with our children”.

Panel 5: The ship is leaving the planet. Sher says “Thank you for supporting me through all this. I really don’t deserve you both. It felt incredibly empowering to tell my parents that you are my new family”. Rowi replies with “Oh come on, my butterscotch toffee, you don’t have to thank me for that. Aren’t families supposed to support and take care of each one of their members?”.
