Chapter is done.

This chapter was extremely challenging to make. Not precisely due to the content- I knew from many chapters ago that this one was going to be dedicated to D- but because I got sick and started this during my worst days, often when I barely had strength to move. Working on this essentially gave me joy and gave me some ground when I felt like I was losing everything, but that also meant making this chapter alone took 3-5 months.

Anyways, Iâ€™m extremely happy with the events of this chapter. The couple that had been in the planning since two years and six months ago is finally official as well. I am very happy because I also managed to create a backstory chapter without using any flashbacks, a challenge I wanted to tackle on for this.

Thanks for enjoying, reading and for your support. See you in a few months!

Russet: it took us awhile to work out how to close this final page.
But this really just struck a chord with us both, Roi outlining how this is all going to change the world and society of bunnies so much.

See you in Chapter 15

htf: Yes!
