Panel 1 has Mekari asking "Roi? Is everything okay? Your steps are a bit heavier than usual, like when you're upset".

Panel 2 shows Roi climbing on Mekari's head. "I'm not upset, Meky. But... just come with me?".

Panel 3 is a big one, showing some of the newly built homes. Roi is riding on top of Mekari's head. She says "I don't think my brother realizes what an immense moment this is. What he is doing fr our species; I don't think he grasps how important it is. And... while he was creating his career and building his family on Earth, I was here. I took you to our foraging events so you could witness how we live. I lived that for over 15 years. This incoming show will be the point where everyone, every single bunny, will see what we saw a couple years ago at Warfaisser, and there's no going back from that. I'm terrified... but excited". To be continued.
