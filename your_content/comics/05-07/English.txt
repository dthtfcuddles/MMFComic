Panel 1: The trio is tight in a big hug. The narration explains “It wasn’t difficult to see what D was doing- They didn’t want to talk about something truly important; they wanted to make us snap out from our state of anger, and funnily enough, even though both Sher and I saw through their intentions, it worked.

Panel 2: The band is playing “…And Justice for All” from Metallica, in their practice room.

Panel 3: The ship is flying. Rowi says “Okay, now thar we let off some steam, we’ve gotta decide what to do from now on. I’m still very angry but we can’t let that stop us now”. D says “Well said” and Sher says “I want to say, let’s focus in the concert. But I can’t dismiss what happened just like that. It isn’t even just about my own species and how thry treated us like cattle until we were almost extinct; they now murdered everyone in a whole planet because they didn’t want to obey. This is personal now”.
