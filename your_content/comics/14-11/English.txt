Panel 1 D asks Sawi "Uh... does this mean that my father is going to be invited again?". Sawi replies "I haven't replied to them yet. I would tell them that you're with us now, so they shouldn't invite him, but ultimately... it's up to you".

Panel 2 has Eikomi hugging D and saying "Hey dear? I'm going to ask you now that Sawi is here. I wanted to ask before but was waiting for the right moment".

Panel 3 Eikomi holds D's hand and says "I'm sorry if this comes up as weird... this is not how we Avali usually do it... but... I studied Earthian customs... uhm... and Daniel? I want you to be my boyfriend".

Panel 4 D holds Eikomi's hands with theirs, and says "Oh, Eiky...".

Panel 5 shows D gently scratching Eikomi's ear while saying "I... I appreciate this more than you can imagine, but... but... I come with baggage ,you know? I... I'm not exactly the best boyfriend material". Eikomi replies, while hugging D, "I know. Do you think I didn't talk to Rowi and Sher before they left? I still want it. Oh, please, keep scratching there, feels nice".

Panel 6 has only dialogue from Eikomi. "I remember when we had just met. You were very uncomfortable with physical affection... and that changed between us. In the same way, I know you can, and will be happy here, Daniel. I love you, and I want you to be part of my life forever. I know you're already ma packmate... but that's the Avali way. I want it to be your way as well. And I'm willing to try and learn".
