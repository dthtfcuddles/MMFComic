Panel 1: (9 hours later) Sher says “Are they really going to tail us until we run out of fuel? They even stopped shooting at us to save ammo”. Rowi replies “They’re abusing the fact we can’t warp while they’re around. We need to lose them, somehow”.

Panel 2: Sher asks “Do you want me to prepare you something? A meal? coffee? Something to drink? You’ve been here without eating anything the whole day”. Rowi replies “Thank you, sugar. Just one of your lunches along with cinati juice, if you can”.

Panel 3: It shows a planet from far away. Rowi says “The closest planet we have is one named RB-33782, also for some reason called ‘Sad balloon’. It’s an extremely inhospitable planet whose atmosphere is loaded with shards of microscopic glass. It has some huge fire storms too. We could try losing him there”.

Panel 4 shows a lunch with a cup of drink. “And there it is. Rice, tomato and chives covered in mushroom sauce. I also added meat balls to yours since I know you love them, and of course, Cinati juice”. Rowi says “Thank you very much, honey”.

Panel 5: Sher and Rowi are staring at the screen where the pirate is saying something. D is asleep at a corner of the room. Rowi says “So far he’s sent 35 videos ranting about stuff and demanding us to surrender. But I also got information about the ship he’s in. He’s safe only because we’re unarmed; his shield is pitiful”.
