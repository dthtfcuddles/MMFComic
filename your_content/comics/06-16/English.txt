Panel 1: Two of the telepathic creatures who organize the festival are checking on the band’s instruments with some things that look like communicators. One of them tells Sher “Your instrument is ready. You guys have been the most painless band we’ve worked with in a long time. Sing something”. Sher sings “Hello, this is John Smith, from Microsoft Support. We are seeing virus activity from your device”. Another of the creatures says “Absolutely perfect. Avali tech is just so nice to work with. Wireless working flawlessly, and extremely fast. We didn’t have to do anything; it was just linking your instruments and then everything was ready and set up”.

Panel 2: D asks “What do you mean we are the most painless band you’ve worked with lately?” and D replies “Since we host bands from all across the universe, very often setting their instruments when they’re electronic is a big royal pain. But your avali stuff… just works”.

Panel 3: Rowi is at his drumkit but using his laptop. One of the creatures tell him “Your drumkit is all set. That laptop… remember you have full light control, we sent you a mail with the setup and how to control them in a script”. Rowi replies with “Yep, I know. We’ll control the lights with our instruments, using thie laptop as a bridge”.

Panel 4: We see a screen showing an avali wallpaper and a “screen resolution setup” dialog in Avali core. Mekari and Roi are shown in the panel staring at said screen. The creatures continue. “Okay, your laptop will have access to the giant screen behind you. During your show you’ll be able to display video or images or your band logo”. Rowi replies with “Perfect”.
