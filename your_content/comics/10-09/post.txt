Russet: Roi is mostly worried because if Sher falls in he will sink. His tail will weigh like 30lbs when soaking wet and he will sink. Of course his visor will protect him with its forcefield but it still wouldn't be fun.
Not that Sher is in much danger with that many friends in the water to look after him.

htf: He's safe and he knows it
