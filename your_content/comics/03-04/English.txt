Panel 1 shows the pallet inside of the spaceship already, being held by a flying drone. Rowi says “This is the order I was waiting for. I’ll take it to the storage room. Computer, lower gravity to 15% password is amino.38″. Sher says “This is a lot of alcohol. I assume you want this stash to last several years, right?”. The AI says “Command accepted succesfully. Gravity will change in 3 minutes”.

Panel 2 Rowi says “Yup, and I’ll gift some of these to others when we visit them. What did you buy with your part of the money?” Sher says “Well, I didn’t have any big things to buy, so I decided to correct a mistake from the last time and I talked with some farmers and bought veggies and crops to grow here on the ship”.

Panel 3 shows several boxes of fruits, vegetables and berries (tomatoes, lettuces, carrots, cabbages and watermelons) plus some planted ones. Rowi is holding a tomato and says “Oh, these are some of the nicest veggies I’ve seen in my life. If we put them in the “zero room” they’ll last for months. Good purchases! Well done honey”. Sher says “Thank you dear”. Rowi continues “And… for the crops we definitely need a bigger ship. We’ll get one when we return to Avalon”.

Panel 4 shows D holding a box with a label in Japanese. D says “Hey guys, you don’t need to wait for me anymore, I just received my package. We can leave anytime you want. Hey, nice veggies”.

Panel 5 shows the ship exiting Earth’s atmosphere. Sher says “That box is rather small. I thought you’d get something bigger as your last memento from Earth. After all, we aren’t going to come back for some years”. D says “… yeah, I am not really attached to this place. If anything, I enjoy way more being away from it. But you know that already”.
