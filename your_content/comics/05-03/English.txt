Panel 1: The ship is escaping. Multiple sphere-shaped explosions are seen all across the planet. Auz’uls says “Holy fuck WHAT!? Is this what they call diplomacy? Their firepower is way bigger than I thought they had!”.

Panel 2: Auz’uls, still shocked, says “I… I am free! I… survived, somehow! and… and… Fucking androids, they… they… ugh… how many people did they kill…?”. While he’s saying that the ship says “1 new message for you”.

Panel 3: There’s a projection of Rowi saying “Hi, Auz’uls. I’m Rowi. I’m sorry for rescuing you this way. We… couldn’t get a rescue from your planet. You’ll see why in a moment. I programmed this message to appear only after leaving the planet you were at.”

Panel 4: “This small vessel should let you get to your closest space station. While you can keep it if you want, we’d appreciate if you could do us a favor in a future. Anyways, that’s not the goal of this message. In your “Home” directory of your spaceship you’ll see a directory named “Planet”.

Panel 5: We see Auz’uls paw touching the ship’s UI, while Rowi’s projection continues. “Any questions you may have… are answered in this folder. I’m so sorry…”.
