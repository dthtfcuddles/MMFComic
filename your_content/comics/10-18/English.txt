Panel 1 shows the Iron going faster and faster, with a countdown.

Panel 2 shows the Iron disappearing (warping away).

Panel 3 shows Rowi interacting with a keyboard, while saying "Everything's going okay! We'll drop out of warp juuust...".

Panel 4 shows the ship in the middle of nowhere. Rowi says "NOW! We are saf-- wait a moment, where's the merchant fleet?".

Panel 5 shows a large ship behind the Iron shooting an immobilizing beam at the Iron. Rowi says "What the hell?".

Panel 6 shows Rowi looking at the screen in front of his seat. There's an alien that looks like a bird wearing a cool visor similar to Rowi's. The person says "Hello, Moumantai Motherfuckers. Sorry for this. My name is KÃ½rit, and we are kidnapping you. We don't want to hurt you, but we need to talk. We'll teleport to your ship in a moment. Don't try anything stupid".
