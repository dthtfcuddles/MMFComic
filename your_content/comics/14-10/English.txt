Panel 1 shows Eikomi and D in D's room. Eikomi is playing a videogame. She says "Okay, that mushroom makes the plumber big, and the frowny mushroom kills him. And damn these are giant pipes". D replies "Also the plumber is desperate for money. Pick the coins; they'll give you extra points".

Panel 2 shows Eikomi looking at her wrist computer saying "Hey, Sawi is calling for us".

Panel 3 shows D interacting with their visor. "Strange, I didn't get any notifications but the mail is here. I'll have to check that later".

Panel 4 shows Sawi. She says "Okay, everyone. I'm very pleased to say that all the initial setup here is done. We have a small village, and everything is ready for the new packs and all the vehicles to arrive in two weeks. The standard Avali net is also ready. The mining operations will start in exactly four weeks, so, now I will rest for a bit and de-stress. Eikomi, your job starts now, dealing with our PR and our public image. About the band: Rowi and Sher will return in three days. I'll tell them by then, but Daniel, dear, I'll tell you in advance: You just received another invitation to be part of the Ultra Music Festival on Warfaisser Space Station, in 6 months".
