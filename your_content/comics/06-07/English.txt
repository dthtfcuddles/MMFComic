Panel 1: The trio is sitting at a table in a restaurant. Rowi and D are holding some pastries, Sher is (like always) biting on something that looks like a coconut, with a plate with veggies on a table. Rowi says “This is one of the most delicious pastries I’ve tried ever! I think these are made with a very sweet meat from Kibarai”. Sher says “Thif taftef like pineapple anf paffion fruif mixed uf”. D says “This tastes like a load of bread that has been dipped in chili con carne. Very good!”.

Panel 2: D is biting their pastry with a very large bite, and someone says “Does that means I should get the same thingies you got? Do you recommend them, cutie?”.

Panel 3 has Eikomi and Sawi in the scene. Rowi is saying “Hey girls!”. Sawi is hugging Sher and saying “Cherry, missed me!?”. Eikomi says with a smile “Rowi, cutie, cherry, how are you?” while D looks with an expression of light shock over being found eating like a beast.

Panel 4: Rowi and Sawi are both cuddling Sher, that just chirrs in pleasure. Rowi says “Glad to see you here. Where are the others?”. Sawi replies with “They’re parking the ship and registering with the password you sent us”. Meanwhile Eikomi was touching D, who says “um… Eikomi? uhm…”. The avali apologies right after “Oh, I forgot. My apologies. I am just used to hugging people I love. I’ll try to remember asking you beforehand next time”.

A note at the bottom of the page says that Kibarai is a planet located somewhere in the GN-Z11 galaxy.
