Panel 1: Rowi is playing his drumkit. Sher tells him from a side “Hey honey? Could you give me a tsst, ts, ts, tss, ts, ts, tss, ts, ts, tss line?”. Rowi replies with “A swing rhythm? Sure! I’ll use a closed hi-hat sound and the highlight with an open one”

Panel 2: D is holding their bass. D tells Sher with a smile “Swing? Funky! Okay, I’ll improvise you a nice song intro. 8 bars you say? Let’s go to the recording room”.

Panel 3: Sher is screaming at a microphone with a large filter: “Don’t stop prying / open up that door! / Learn to cry, there’s no shame anymore! / Breaking on your ball / Screwed up / Fucked up! / Your war is just so fucked up!
