Panel 1: It shows the US president from that era next to some aliens. The narration says “In 1978 our existence was finally revealed to the ‘normal people’. While there were some people unhappy or complaining, in general our image was positive. Socially things had advanced enough, ready to enter a decade that a lot of humans miss a lot: The 80s. This was a constant around the world. The aliens who had been here for decades helped immensely to sway people’s opinion of us favorably”. The president says “And my fellow Americans! Our friends from Outer Space have extended us an invitation to join the Space Coalition, where we rightfully belong!”.

Panel 2: It shows Xunkiira and Rachel sitting down at a table from some fast food place. They’re holding each other’s hand; they’re sitting at the different sides of each table. The narration says “After 11 years on Earth, my time there was over. I had to tell Rachel, who was extremely sad. I knew that she wanted to propose to me, but she was scared over the social pressure for both, interspecies and a same-sex relationship.

Panel 3: It shows a ship (’flying disc’) leaving Earth. The narration explains. “After some weeks, I left Earth. But funnily enough, I wasn’t sad; while our goodbye was indeed sad, this time Rachel wasn’t feeling down or teary…”

Panel 4: “Because I brought her with me! he he he”. Rachel and Kiira are together, greeting the camera while they hold some luggage bags. “Of course, everything was planned and well agreed. Her parents gave us their blessing and we’d return to Earth to see them every two years”.

Panel 5: It shows the photo of both, a very old Rachel and Kiira hugging. “Rachel became and was my half-orange and my best friend for 41 more years until last year. I miss her, but… she told me she didn’t regret anything. That her life was the best one she could’ve even dreamed with. I am happy that I could have the honor of being the bringer of her happiness. I also don’t have any regrets in my life.”
