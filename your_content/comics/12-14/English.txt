Panel 1 we see the hovercart traveling full speed. Sher says "Let me see if I understood. You found the cave we were going to visit and it's an awesome place to move into?.

Panel 2 shows all bunnies traveling in the hovercar. One says "Yep! The locaion is great, with good foraging places, and the cave is spacious". Another bunny says "It's a perfect place. The water is good as well, our only worry is the move itself, this is very far away". Rowi says "Oh, don't worry about that. Tell me more about the cave".

A bunny says "The cave has a large underground lake and plenty of safe flora. It has also glowy berries and rocks. I am sure everyone will love it!".

Panel 4 shows some grass and bushes. "It has two entrances, both almost impossible to see and too small for any predators. Even we would have issues coming in". D says "Ohhh sweet! You won the lottery!". A bunny asks "What's a lottery, Dee-Friend?".
