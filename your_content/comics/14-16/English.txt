Panel 1 shows the snow falling now very slowly. D continues. "Remembering it now makes me feel like an asshole... because I was. Rowi and Sher were the first people to ever treat me as an equal, offering respect and making me feel loved".

Panel 2 shows both D and Eikomi looking to the window, with Eikomi hugging D's shoulder. D says "And at some point the hate I was feeling towards him shifted to myself. I hated how I hated him. His kindness made me feel even worse".

Panel 3 shows Rowi and Sher smiling with hearts. D says "Rowi was kind and nice, putting up with my bullshit, the times I was mean to him for no reason, the times I just acted like I didn't care, and all he did was to be nice towards me. I even overheard him telling Sher that I had potential. That he believed I could change my attitude. Rowi's kindness... what got me. He was nice with everyone, not just me. He just enjoyed being nice. It's easy to see why Sher fell in love with him. And sometimes, I wonder what was Rowi's real opinion about me back then, when I acted like an asshole for no reason."

Panel 4 Eikomi, fidgeting nervously with her fingers, says "Well, dear... I admit there's some truth in what you thought. We are very privileged. We're high in the Avali hierarchy... and we didn't really know what suffering truly is. We had to lose a brother... and witness how things are outside to learn how lucky we've been since we were born".

Panel 5 shows the sky, now almost clear and showing stars. "... But if I can tell you one thing... is that from the very beginning, Rowi couldn't say anything but good things about you. That's why I was so excited to meet you... 'cutie'".
