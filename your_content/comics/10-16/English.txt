Panel 1 shows the Iron (the band's ship) in position. Dialogue counts down. "Direction set up. 5594022282810.664. Ejection in 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1...".

Panel 2 says "zero!" showing the same angle but the ship flying away at full speed.

Panel 3 shows the ship and what looks like small jolts. The dialogue says "OK, this is a terrific EMP bomb. We can see only sparks... but... look, our navigation systems are all borker. The ship's AI is keeping our direction steady, but we'd be in super hard trouble without it... and I bet that the plan was succesful and that the EMP also fried all the drones flying above us". Someone replies "Let's hope".

Panel 4 shows the Horker king asleep in a small crystal chamber. A dialogue says "Our dear Majesty, something disabled all the drones on the opposite side of the planet just a minute ago. That area is now invisible".

Panel 5 shows the Horker king with a drop of blood on his head. saying in what looks like a tranquil fury, "Can't I even sleep in peace? What did I train you morons for? Just follow the protocol, the fact you had to come tell me is wasting valuable time. Replace the dead drones with working ones, and look around where it happened, maybe we can catch whoever did it to torture them later".
