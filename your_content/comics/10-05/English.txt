First panel: It shows the band in a floating platform that is around 50x100 meters, the ship parked behind. Rowi is wearing a cute big hat, Sher goes normal and D is wearing some tropical shirt and shorts. One of the Unmizu (fish people) say "Hello and welcome, friends. Our immigration rules are set up to avoid trouble with the Kuyorui. As such, neither you nor your ship can stay here, so you and your ship will be taken to our city".

Second panel shows the unmizu tail and Sher following. Sher asks "Who are the Kuyorui?" and the Unmizu replies "They're the land-based dominant species on this planet".

The third panel shows the platform from a distance. Rowi says "The Unmizu and the Kuyorui have rivalries since centuries ago. Without going to detail, the Kuyorou see 'water people' as abominations. The Unmizu retreated into the deep water to prevent a war, and that's where they stand today". Sher says "Ahhh I see!" and the Unmizu replies "Yes. We lived near the surface back in the day, but those times are long gone. Today we live deep underwater. The platform taking us to Cytak City will take around 50 minutes".

The next panel shows the band going deep underwater in a lift with a very thick crystal. Sher says "I know I've been living in space for years... and that vois is less terrifying than being underwater".

The final panel shows the band going down in what looks like a transparent giant pipe.
