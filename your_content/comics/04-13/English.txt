Panel 1 shows the Iron flying across space. "The day after, Sher and I traveled to Avalon. D had asked us if they could stay at Protion with the rest of the pack during the couple days we'd be at my birth place repairing and upgrading the ship. We accepted".

Panel 2 shows a planet covered in clouds. "Avalon, one of several moons orbiting the ice giant 'Valaya', is the home place of the Avali species. With a diameter of around 9075 kilometers (~5640 miles) and 1/4 the gravity of Earth, this winter wonderland houses very unique kinds of flora and fauna that are mainly ammonia based, and can get quite large. In spite of its blue-ish and white colors, thanks in no small part to its ice and very dense clouds, this moon is actually quite dark, with said clouds almost permanently covering the sky".

Panel 3 shows the Iron flying above some trees with a very dark sky. "Upgrading our ship was one of our big priorities, even if we hadn't decided what kind of upgrade we would choose. In addition, we were going to add a medbay. I wanted to buy some upgrades for my drumkit (including a xylophone or a marimba) and my glazed carrot wanted to buy a new guitar, one that would work out-of-the-box with all our Avali tech".
