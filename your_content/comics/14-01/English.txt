Panel 1 shows a few dome shaped houses. Someone says "The first village is finished, exactly as you requested. The blueprints were followed to perfection". Someone replies "We can see that. They look great on the outside and are packed on the inside. Very stylish".

Panel 2 shows the interior of one of these dome homes, with an avali telling Sawi "We appreciate the compliments, miss Sawi. May I request them in writing?". Sawi replies "Sure. But I have something even better for you and your pack than a mere recommendation for a job well done".

Panel 3 has Eikomi and D outside. Eikomi asks "What do you think about the new homes, D-R?" and D replies "They look cool as hell! It reminds me of an anime, 'Dragon Ball'".

Panel 4 Eikomi asks "Huh? What's an 'anime'?" and D replies "... Oh my god! You're in for a ride. Get a lot of snacks and come to my room. We're gonna disappear for a few days".
