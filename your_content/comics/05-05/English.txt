Panel 1: Sher is in his bed. His face is buried on the bedclothes/mattress. Someone says “Sher, it’s me, may I come in?”.

Panel 2: Sher looks to a side, frowning. “Yes, D, you can. But… I’m not in my best mood. I apologize in advance. I’m just… so angry that I can’t think straight”.

Panel 3: A package of sour gummies lands next to Sher’s face. “I know. Take this, it usually improves my mood when I’m upset”.

Panel 4: Sher is angrily eating the sour gummies, sitting in his bed, with D sitting next to him and scratching his head.
