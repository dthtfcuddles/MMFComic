Panel 1: The ship is flying over a beach with palm trees and a spaceship parking spot at the distance. Rowi says “This planet’s atmosphere is incredibly similar to Earth’s, so much that we can use the same EPP [Environmental Protection Pack] we used for years there”.

Panel 2: The band is walking. Rowi and Sher are looking surprised, while D is just with their eyes closed and his arms on the back of their head. Sher says “The views are pretty! They’re almost identical to Earth’s!”.

Panel 3: An alien that looks like a mouse with little antennas, beady eyes, spiky hair, hands that look like a teddy bear’s paw with thin fingers protuding from there and wearing a simple tunic says “Welcome to Teriki, strangers. We don’t get many visitors. So make yourselves feel at home”.

Panel 4: It shows Rowi and the mouse front to front, the mouse saying “A visitor from Avalon? What are you doing on a planet as warm as ours?”.
