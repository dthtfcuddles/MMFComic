Russet: Ever wonder why Mekari fluctuates between lorge and not quite so lorge? It's not lazy drawing, it is down to some behind the scenes Sleriki lore concerning how their bio-cycle works over the year. I can't explain it all here Vic would tell me off for writing a 20,000 word essay on Alien Slime Anatomy, just trust me Sleriki are just cool!
htf: They shed excess mass and regain it as they eat. Its quite simple. I know Russet just wants to write his 20K word essay tho, gotta think where to post it. Maybe on a species-themed wiki article or something?
