Panel 1: It shows the band greeting their audience during the UMF. D continues. “We got invited to participate in a huge space music festival at Warfaisser Station. Our performance was amazing!”.

Panel 2: Sher is singing with the eyes closed. “We performed a song talking about the horker’s cruelty, making them much more widely known, while also putting Sher’s species on the radar”.

Panel 3: The narration continues. “After said festival, his sister (who had become super close with Mekari) joined us as a roadie. They became essentially roommates”. The panel shows both Roi and Mekari in a room, Mekari playing videogames in a big bed, and Roi in another bed located high enough so she’s at Mekari’s head level. Roi says “You’re very good, meky. I have more fun watching you than playing”.

Panel 4: The narration goes on. “They underwent some training to handle weapons, since one of their duties would turn them into our bodyguards, or security guards. I almost forgot to mention Roi has ADHD, but that’s being treated now too”. The panel shows both Roi and Mekari holding swords as big as them (or slightly bigger), with two Avali (one of them being Kig) in armor talking to them. One of the Avali says “These greatswords will be the bane of anyone who happens to go against you”.
