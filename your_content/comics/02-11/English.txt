Panel 1: Sher is screaming under the pillow “Argh! Why can’t we get a fucking break!? Aaaahhh” while Rowi has an awkward expression.

Panel 2 Rowi tells him “I’m sorry for being the bearer of bad news, but you know what’ll happen if someone discovers you’re sitting on the largest reserve of gabireum [Alien mineral used in nanocomputers] I’ve seen”. Sher replies “I know! Damn it! And I don’t know what to do!”.

Panel 3 shows a sunrise. Sher continues “Like I mentioned before, we aren’t a technological species. I doubt anybody can even begin to understand the situation even if we explain it”. Rowi replies “Let’s breathe deep and try to sleep and clear our minds. Tomorrow we can decide and plan what to do”.

Panel 4 shows Sher in his bed, the room is dark. The ship’s AI chimes in. “Attention: Someone is outside”.

Panel 5 shows Roi (Sher’s sister). “Brother! Are you there! I know you’re there! I can smell you! Please! I need to talk with you, please!”.
