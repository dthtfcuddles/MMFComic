Panel 1: Sawi is showing something very small to Sher, Kai, Nau, Roi and Mekari, while Naha and D play Freedoom in the background. Sawi explains “Right now I’m holding a translator. You put it inside of your ear and you’ll be able to understand what others speak. You can find many, many different designs for these, tailored to different species, but the ones I hold are good for us avalis and for you bunnies. For context, Sher used one of these for years”. Sher says “Yep, it’s true. The only reason why I stopped using one of these myself is because I got a more powerful version that lets me speak too. But since everyone here is using their own translator, you don’t really need that”.

Meanwhile in the background D says “I didn’t know someone translated Freedoom to avali core”.

Panel 2: The band is playing in their hotel room; Sher is screaming the lyrics of Arch-Enemy’s ‘Reason to Believe’. “There’s a reason to believe again! There’s a reason to go on! Always keep on fighting, my friend!”. The narration explains “The next day almost everyone went out to explore the space station. We used the time to practice some more”.

Panel 3: Naha is showing a glass flask containing a California reaper, with Eikomi, Nau and Khi in the background. He says “…They were selling this as a delicious snack from Earth, and they told me it’s a very special fruit for very special events, and since this is a special event I thought we could eat it together today!”. Sher, Rowi and D all have sweat drops on their heads, with Rowi saying “Naha, if you get that thing even remotely close to your mouth, you’ll die. Toss it to the trash can NOW”.
