Panel 1: D explains “We travel across the universe, playing for whoever wants to listen to us”. The panel shows the band playing for a group of Sleriki (panel from chapter 1). Sher says “Are you ready to rock?”.

Panel 2: We see Mekari greeting. D’s narration continues. “The last year was extremely eventful. First we played for a species of peaceful slime monsters. One of them, Mekari, joined us as a roadie.

Panel 3: We see Sher and Rowi sitting next to a bunny-like alien. The narration says "Then we were tasked with delivering a distress message by a mullow called Auz'uls…”

Panel 4: The band ship is flying over ruins and smoke “… but when we arrived, we found out the Mullow species had been completely wiped out by horkers”.

Panel 5: Two horkers are in the scene. “Horkers are an alien species that, as cartoonishly cliché as it sounds, are trying to take over the universe. They’re known for their cruelty”.

Panel 6: “My brother Sher also has a personal grudge against them, because they almost wiped his species out of existence, treating them like cattle”. The panel shows Sher performing at the UMF and saying very angrily “Fuck you”.
