Panel 1: Rowi says “Guys? We’re being following by a drone right now”.

Panel 2 shows the drone and Rowi says “It looks just like a small reconnaissance robot, but I can’t get any information about its owner. At least it looks like it’s unarmed”.

Panel 3: The ship is entering the planet’s atmosphere. Rowi says “And as soon as we entered to the planet’s atmosphere, it stopped following us. Do you know anything about it, pumpkin spice?”. Sher replies “Not really, but we aren’t a technological species. Only now that I’ve learned I’m noticing things I didn’t before I left”.

Panel 4: Sher tells D “Oh, yes, D, adjust your EPP [Environmental Protection Pack] for cold temps”. D replies with a “mhm”.

Panel 5: The ship is going down through a canopy of trees. Sher says “Oh god! Cinati trees! I miss that fruit so much! Aaahhh I truly am back home!”.
