Panel 1: The ship is flying. The narration says “We set course to the satellite where the event would be held. We’d arrive in one week, so we had the equivalent to 7 Earth days to get used to the place (and practice). We also used the time to plan every detail about our show, from the lights to the overall theme.

Panel 2: There’s a building that looks like a vertical pen whose tail is a crystal dome, surrounded by rings. The narration says: “Warfaisser, sector EB-568A7. Originally a space station, it was abandoned when it was ravaged by a deadly disease. Eventually it was found by a species of telepathic aliens who cleaned it up and repurposed it as a tourist center whose focus is showcasing arts from all across the universe.”

Panel 3: There’s a ton of aliens of different types and species walking around. D says “There’s way more people than I expected”, and Rowi replies with “I’m not surprised. This is a touristic station, and not everyone comes for the festival”.

Panel 4: The trio is registering at the hotel reception. An alien with four hanging eyes and a comically small bowtie holds a document and says “Yes, I have your info here. You’re VIP. You also have two extra rooms for your families. You’ll see a password in your room; tell your families to give it to us and they will get access to the VIP rooms for free too.”. Rowi replies with “Gotcha”.

Panel 5: Rowi is using a card to open the hotel room door. He says “Mekari will bring our stuff and we’ll let him have one of the two rooms so he can be comfy”. Sher replies with “And the other room for the pack? I approve of that!”. D is behind them, holding the back of his head with his hands.
