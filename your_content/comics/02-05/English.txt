Panel 1: Sher is walking into the entrance, while Rowi and D talk. D says “Wait, 13 years? Why do his documents say he’s 23?”. Rowi replies “The document list ages in a standard galactic format. It’s a good way to get around each planet having their own time measurement.”

Panel 2: It shows Sher walking down a cave, while Rowi continues “In Earth years he’s a lot older. Probably around his thirties”.

Panel 3: It shows Sher being seen from the point of view of another Vampire Bunny (the panel shows their hands).

Panel 4: D says, while putting their hands on the back of their head “That’s interesting. I had no idea. To be honest… normally I don’t care. I don’t even care about families in general. I’d rather be sleeping at the ship”. Rowi says “Yeah, you’ve been very chatty today, that’s very unusual for you. What’s up?”

Panel 5: It shows a drone raising in the middle of the scenario. D continues. “I dunno? Maybe this time I actually do want a taste of what a normal family is and… uh… what’s that?”.

Panel 6: Shows the drone next to D’s face. Rowi says “That’s a very weird looking drone”.
