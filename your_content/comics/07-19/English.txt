Panel 1: The ship is arriving to the bunny planet. Some trees can be seen with the ship in the background. The narration says “We arrived at Babupekkakerok without any issues. The snow hid the entrances to the deep caves vampire bunnies inhabited. The rest of the pack arrived around 5 hours later in another spaceship. Sher’s parents invited us inside to have some ‘tea’ like the first time we came here (Actually is just hot springs water with a piece of leaf from a Cinati tree). We accepted, but sadly Mekari had to stay out due to his size. He was chill with that, though, and decided to stay in the ship to avoid the cold temperatures.

Panel 2: Roi is taking out some trinkets in a box, including a Ryo-Ohki plush, a gameboy with a couple games, a bill, some coins, a pendrive, etc. She says "We’re gonna visit space once more, guys. Isn’t it awesome?”. The narration says “Roi retrieved her trinkets, stuff she got when she visited Earth. Some were small worthless things, but they had a huge sentimental value for her”.

Panel 3: Rowi and Sher are standing inside of one of the caves inhabited by the bunnies. Next to them D is on his knees hugging Nau and Khi. D says “Mom… dad… we will be back in a year or two. We will stay in contact”. Khi says “We’ll wait for you with our arms open, dear D”.
