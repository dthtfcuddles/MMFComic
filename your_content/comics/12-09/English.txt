Panel 1: Shows the trio going through a very small tunnel; while Sher can walk standing, both Rowi and Sher must crouch/crawl. Sher says "We're approaching the village".

Panel 2 shows Sher saying "Okay, end of the road. There's a small pit.

Around 3 meters deep, we can jump down". Panel 3 shows Sher and Rowi landing while D is just going down using a rope.

Panel 4 shows two vampire bunnies holding spears. One says "Sher!? Is it really you?" and the other says "I told you I recognized that scent! Hi Sher!!! Welcome!!! What are you doing here? Who are your friends?".
