Panel 1 shows the trio in their tent. Sher is the only one awake.

Panel 2 shows how Sher is receiving a message on his visor, saying "Cherry, if you're awake, put on one of your best robes and come to the main tent. You don't need to wake Rowi and Daniel, but you can do so if you want". Sher says "huh?".

Panel 3 shows Sher and Sawi walking, Sawi says "Sorry for calling you at this hour, Cherry, but I got you and audience with the head pack of the Illuminate". Sher says "it's okay, the ship has a 32-hour long day, and for me its just hour 27".

Panel 4 has Sher slowly realizing and reacting. "Ã„H!? W--what do you mean 'the head pack of the Illuminate'? The pack leading the entire Avali species!? I think I need to stop listening to music as loud as I do because I'm sure I'm losing my sense of hearing. I must've heard you wrong".

Panel 5 has Sawi saying "Not at all. When we said we ar ehigh in the Avali hierarchy, we mean it. Listen to me, Cherry. You're getting a unique chance to help your entire species. And don't worry, I'll be with you. I'll take over if you get any kind of panic attack, but you should do well, you can handle audiences just fine".
