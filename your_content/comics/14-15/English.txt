Panel 1: It shows a blizzard with a thunderbolt. "The weather was harsh. Sher called it the 'Screaming Snow', and the sky kept screaming for a few days, forcing everyone to stay inside while the storm lasted".

Panel 2 has Eikomi playing videogame while D lies on the bed. Eikomi says "What's on your mind, dear? You've been quite silent lately. Ugh! Fucking spikes! Lemme grab that bandage!". D replies "For years I didn't want to talk about my past. Rowi and Sher know most of it, though... and now you do. And..."

Panel 3 shows the same scene but from another angle, Eikomi resting her head on D's side. D continues. "... Trusting others like this... trusting you, feels right, but also weird". Eikomi replies "... Is it the fear of being judged?".

Panel 4 shows the blizzard going on with another thunderbolt. "... Maybe".

Panel 5 shows the blizzard calmed down, being just snow. D says "You know, when I joined MMF... I actually hated Rowi. I resented him. I saw him as a rich kid who didn't know what suffering was".
