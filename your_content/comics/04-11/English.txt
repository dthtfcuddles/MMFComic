Panel 1 shows D coming out of the tent with the laptop under their arm.

Panel 2 D is interrupted by Sher. The bunny says "Um... D? May I... come with you tonight?". D says "Of course, Sher".

Panel 3 shows them sitting down at a small hill close to the tents, with the view of a planet in the sky. D says "You know, I don't think I've ever told you how much you guys mean to me. This journey has literally been a 'find your family' one, and I couldn't have dreamed of a better one. I have... so many things I want to say and I don't even know how to start. Your family, Rowi's pack... Why are you all so generous towards me? I... just... um... actually... I have no idea where I was going with all this. It's just... so unusual for me. I'm not used to be at the receiving side of love". Sher replies with "We love you, D, and I'm so happy that we could become tha family we are. I know I always mention how much I love Rowi; he's my boyfriend and I adore him, but you are just as important in my life. For me, you are my brother."
