Panel 1: Sher is holding the Christmas evergreen decoration Rowi’s drumkit had attached. He says “Since we were notified of this gig, fear has been in the back of my head. We’ve been doing this for years now… and the stage fright has never completely subsided. I can tame it just because I have my friends, my family with me this time. However… I got even more support: My whole family. Not just my dear boyfriend and my Earth brother or our giant slime friend. Also my bunny family and my Avali family and… and… I love you!”

Panel 2: Sher wrapped himself in the evergreen, making him look fabulous. “This time I’m not allowed to feel scared, and I’ll always, always be thankful for everything I got. The next song is about an Avali who didn’t have that chance: Lost in Space. Let’s do this shit”.

Panel 3: It shows D doing his bass slapping in a pose very styled after Ryan Martinie. Sher sings “♪ Kauko said goodbye to their last packmate, the last survivor of a pirate invasion. Lost in the middle of the space they did not know how to return home ♪”

Panel 4 Shows Rowi playing while Sher sings another song, the bunny leaning his head against Rowi. “♪ Don’t say you love me, you don’t even know me, if you really want me then give me some time. Don’t go there baby, not before I’m ready, don’t say your heart’s in a hurry, ’s not like we’re gonna get married, gimme, gimme, some time ♪”.
