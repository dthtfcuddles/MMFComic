Panel 1 shows the Horker King, several armed soldiers and a bunch of bunnies along with Rowi, D and Sher facing them. The narration says. "Apparently, the Horker King arrived with his army to try to look intimidating". The Horker King says "Ha ha ha, so you're the vampire bunny I've been hearing about for a while now. Who are these two aliens? Friends of yours? Anyways, let's talk about the matter at hand. We are coming to take this wild planet for the Horker Empire. Do you have anything to say?".

Panel 2 shows Sher saying "First, King Ky√≥urgawabadi, as the official diplomat of the bunny species, I speak for them. You aren't welcome here. Leave at once. Second, this meeting is being livestreamed right now".

Panel 3 shows the Horker King grinning and saying "Livestreamed? Okay, I give you some credit, you are smarter than I expected. Or did one of your friends suggest you to do that? Also, addressing me by my name and not my title? Brave move. Okay, Sher Ouakkia. I'm here to re-establish control over your planet, in accordance with the established Coalition protocol".

Panel 4 shows Sher checking text on his visor while saying "Ugh... okay, let's see. You're telling us beforehand to prevent bloodshed. You're showing your army. You're not attacking right away. Uh...". Rowi interrupts him saying "Sher?".

The last panel shows Rowi saying "Sher. Before this goes on, and with the Horker King as a witness, I have a proposition for you".
