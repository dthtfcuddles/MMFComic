Panel 1 shows Protion, with a small box saying "Protion, a few days later...", and dialogue saying "...and that's exactly what happened. We need to warn the bunnies as soon as possible!".

Panel 2 shows Sawi thinking deeply.

Panel 3 shows Sawi with a decided expression. "Okay, using my neural processor I've calculated at least 75 billion possibilities with all this. First, yes, we need to warn the vampbuns, but just warning them is not going to be enough. D is right... we need help. Remember, we're a mining pack, and this is foreign policy. If we want to get help from the Illuminate, we need to follow the rules and correct protocols and get the right branch of the government to help us. As the pack leader, I'm going to contact J'ask, the head of Resource Adquisition for the Illuminate (our direct boss) and ask them what we can do. For now you're all dismissed. I will let you know when I have an answer".

Panel 4 shows Sawi looking back and saying "Oh, and Cherry, I don't think I need to say it but we're family and we have your back. I'd rather not due to the time loss, but if we need to avalon to plead this case, we will".

The last panel has Sher saying "Wawa Sawi" ('Thank you, Sawi' in Avali Core).
