Chapter done. It was a very fast paced one, and that was intentional; I had to set up the new background for the incoming chapters. That’s also why this chapter had a lot of alien politics in it.
This chapter was also a posting challenge due to me falling very sick. This is the reason why ch14 is gonna be delayed; originally i expected to complete this now in April and ch14 in June, but I will put on a safe bet and say ch14 will come in August, even tho there are chances its done before that.
Anyways, I hope you liked this! More raptor bird friends is always good. I’ll be introducing them properly as they come.

Russet: This was a great chapter to work on together and we got to put to use all the cool lore we had created for the Avali.

htf: And also to show that while Rowi is a smart birb in the band, that he's not flawlessly smart, he can be reckless and stuff. It was a subtle development, but a character development after all.
