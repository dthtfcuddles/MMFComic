Panel 1: Shows a space station, vertical shape with a horizontal long aisle crossing it at the top, and something that looks like a cog in the middle. There's a description saying "Karu space station, RCH-448, Galacy SCL-53". Someone is saying "We hope you're having a great time! We are MMF and this is gonna be our last song!".

Panel 2 shows a creature that looks like something between a small bunny with floppy ears or a small dog. This creature has a pear shaped body and a long big fluffy tail. They’re wearing a headset with a microphone sticking from it. Behind them there’s an alien wearing a visor, with beady eyes, leaning forward while sitting at a drumkit. The small bunny says "Thank you everyone for inviting us to this lovely place to play our weird Earth-based art in here!" while holding an electric guitar.

Panel 3 shows, now from an angle at the side/slightly behind the drummer, who now can be seen as having four ears and feathers resembling wings on their arms. They're playing with a smile, while in front of the drumkit (that is an e-drumkit, with four pieces plus at least three cymbals and a laptop controlling everything) the bunny sings in avali "It's not your fault if you're damaged! It’s not your fault if you're broken! Rise up!". Next to the bunny there's a deer, seen from behind, holding another string instrument that could be a guitar or a bass. We can also see a small audience consisting of different kinds of aliens, animal-shaped aliens and a couple humans.
