The idea that sparked this comic had been in development for a while, along with a lot of world building.
However, the comic itself was started randomly in an inspiration moment, and finished in record time between commissions.

I will talk about things like how this comic returned me the motivation and love I had for drawing comics once I post the last page of this chapter. But right now, enjoy this comic.

This is not going to be a fetish comic. Its actually marked as a 15+ comic due to swearing and touching some dark topics- stuff that comes with the territory when we're talking about rock and metal music.
