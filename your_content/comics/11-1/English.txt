Panel 1 shows a large spaceship holding the Iron immobile using some sort of beam. Someone says "Welcome to the 'Voidrunner', MMF". Someone replies "hm".

Panel 2 shows the trio being immobilized by something like hard gum. Behind them there are two aliens. The dialogue continues. "We need to talk. Sorry for doing it this way...".

Panel 3 shows a bird alien wearing a visor, and a scrawny vampire bunny next to him, smoking. The bird continues. "... But even if it's difficult to believe, we aren't your enemies".

Panel 4 shows Rowi saying "Do you realize the Illuminate will be ramming warshops down your throats any second now since we never arrived?".

In the last panel the Vampire bunny says "Ah yes, the Illuminate, the ones who lost you while in friendly territory. We're so scared, dealing with professionals. Good luck finding us in this remote, never officially charted galaxy".
