Panel 1: The ship is going away. The space is filled with stars, a couple nebulas and some celestial bodies more shiny than others. The narration says “We decided to go back to Avalon, to buy a new bass for D. After that, we’d start preparing for our biggest gig to date. But, as it’s been the norm so far, we didn’t know how crazy this was going to be”. To be continued…

Another detail regarding the next chapter: Originally I was going to make it a long 30 page chapter, but I will divide in two chapters of ~15 pages. It should come around sometime around June, or probably late May if I manage to speed up.
