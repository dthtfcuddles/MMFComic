This is it. Chapter 5 is complete.

I am very aware that technically this chapter felt like a mess, with a *lot* of lore being dropped all of a sudden. The next chapter, however, goes back to the more happy vibe, even if it’s going to be crazy. At least this chapter I finally set up to properly introduce Horkers, that had a small apparition even back in Chapter 1, and also explained why Earth is so welcoming to aliens.

With this I also celebrate... 100 pages! Woohoo!

When I started this I was scared over the idea of not being able to complete 30 pages. But look at this <3 I’m going to celebrate with... actually i cant celebrate right now, I gotta go to sleep because tomorrow i have RL appointments to do. But this saturday or sunday I’m probably going to celebrate with chips and soda.

Thank you peeps for looking at this story. I hope youre liking it so far.

See you in Chapter 6!
