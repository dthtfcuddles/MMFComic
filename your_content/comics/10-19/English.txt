Panel 1 shows everyone but Mekari being tied by something sticky that's being spat out by a slug-like creature behind them (who is also pointing at Rowi with a weapon). However, an alien with horns is holding a gun against Mekari. This alien says "Don't move, Sleriki, this is a freezing weapon. Also, if you try anything, my... my companion will shoot your avali friend!". The avian alien is facing them. "Finally, we meet face to face. We've been eager to meet you for a while. Listen to me. We will teleport you to our own ship and we will talk there".

In panel 2 the avian says "Just don't resist and we will not harm you". Panel 3 shows Sher saying "It's almost like we had no other option, right? What do you want? Are you going to sell us as slaves or something?".

The next panel is identical but Sher has a shocked expression when someone tells him in his mother language "I wouldn't do that to one of my own".

The final panel shows mainly a shadow, with the dialog "Captain KÃ½rit... Actually the whole crew offered to do this operation for me without even asking more than I was willing to explain. That's what I call my "found family"... Someday I'll return the favor. Anyways, for now, it's nice to meet you, Sher Ouakkia".
