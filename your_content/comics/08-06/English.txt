Panel 1: Bunnies coming with a lot of fruit and berries. “Here’s the haul of the day. We managed to bring an intact Cinati fruit too!”, “Also, we need to exchange information with our relay party immediately. It’s super important!”. The narration says “Anyways, I kept doing my work and foraging along with my party. It was physically demanding, tiring but it was how our village survived.

Panel 2: Narration: "The elders of the village (my parents among them) were very happy with our work. All the foraging parties worked together and as such we never had to starve”. A young Khi says “You did a great work again. The younglings will be happy”.

Panel 3: Sher is sleeping in a hay bed with a tear in his eye. The narration says “However… I wasn’t happy. We were just encouraged to move on. We had no choice. Carry on and survive. Everyone had lost someone. This is why we were discouraged from creating deep connections with others. And I had done exactly that”.

Panel 4: Sher and Roi are flying together in a starry night. Sher says “W…where are we? What… are you doing?” and Roi replies “Hold my hand, little brother! We’re going places today!”.
