Panel 1: Mekari asks “The legend of ‘Rudolph the Reindeer’? What’s that?”. Roi replies “It’s the story of a reindeer, an Earth species a bit similar to D’s, who had to step up to save Christmas Day. I learned it the year I was visiting Earth”.
Panel 2: Rowi holds a gift. He says “The legend says that 'Santa Claus goes in a sleigh and gives gifts to every kid on Earth during Christmas night. That’s the jist of it”.
Panel 3: Rowi is hugging Sher, who’s holding a small tree enclosed in a crystal ball. Rowi continues. “Thing is… we don’t really need anything; due to our technology and position we have everything we could ever want, so our special tradition revolves just in giving cute mementos to each other”. Sher says “A mini tree! Thank you honey! I’ll put it in my room next to the others”.
Panel 4: D is looking at a photo, saying “Is this… a family photo? Wait, this is the family photo we took before our concert at Warfaisser last year! Thank you guys!”.
Panel 5: Mekari says “I see. But… is Christmas the reason why we’re flying to Earth right now? I thought we were just going to tour around the places Sher was talking about some months ago”.
Panel 6: The ship flies, while someone replies “Yes and no. We want to be there for New Year too. There are some other reasons, but we’ll explain them at some other moment”.
