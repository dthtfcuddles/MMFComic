Panel 1 shows Sher asking Sawi "Uh... big sis? Where's Kig?". Sawi replies "He's training in the countryside". Sher says "Oh? Training?".

Panel 2 has Sawi saying, with a smile, "Being a member of the Avali Defenders means having to train and stay sharp at all times". Sher says "Avali Defenders? Huh?" and Rowi says "Don't worry about it honey, I'll explain later".

Panel 3 D and Eikomi are hugging. D says "And how was the trip, guys? Do anything fun on your trip to Earth?".

Panel 4 Rowi says "We went to a resort that is usually reserved for politicians and CEOs and important people, it happened that said people were attending an event on Earth's moon. Anyways, we had the place to ourselves". Sher says "It was quite boring, though, so after that we decided to visit countries and buy souvenirs. We got stuff we think you'll like".

In Panel 5 Kalani asks "Does that stuff includes an "Atari 800XL" or a "Commodore 64"?.

In panel 6 Sher says "Yep! Not just that! We bought a bunch of game consoles, so you two will have a lot to enjoy and explore".
