Panel 1: It shows a planet with two moons. The description says “Sher’s home planet, Babupekkakerok, is a small celestial body located around 225 million light years away from Avalon [625 million light years away from Earth], being around half of said planet’s size [Around 1/3 the radius of Earth]. Its source of light is a yellow-ochre red giant, and it has two moons surrounding it, both rotating against each other. Babupekkakerok has four continents separated by oceans that are usually frozen, and all its biomes are quite similar.

This planet is catalogued as a "Death planet”, filled with an enormous amount of perils that make any attempts at survival on it incredibly challenging; its flora and fauna are extremely dangerous.

Originally discovered by a pirate vessel, this beautiful winterland’s surface temperatures shift between -55°C (-67°F) and 3°C (37°F) near its equator; however, the temperatures underground are a lot more habitable and less prone to extremes (-10°C/14°F to 10°C/50°F).

Panel 2: Sher asks “Who wrote that description? It sounds nice and I think it’s accurate”. Rowi replies with “I’m sure it was Sawi. She even gave it the appropriate name ‘Babupekkakerok’ which means 'Vampbun packmate land’.

Panel 3: It shows Mekari and Roi sleeping together. The narration says "Our return home was uneventful. It was a calm week where we had the chance to truly rest. Roi and Mekari were never seen apart; the two had gotten incredibly close, and we were wondering what would happen with them once we arrived at Sher’s homeland”.
