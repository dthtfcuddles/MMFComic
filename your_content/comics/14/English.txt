<b>The Iron:</b> The ship that transports the band across the universe. Manufactured in Avalon, it has a highly efficient engine that feeds with hydrogen. The ship’s interior is bigger than it looks from outside, technology borrowed from the Calaros race, and it has five rooms, one for each member of the band, one storage room and one common room with tables and a kitchen. It’s also armed with a cloaking device.

Max (regular) speed: 3500 Km/h. Warp igniter: 270 seconds. Cloak: 15 second activation, 360 second duration.

<b>Sleriki</b>: These friendly creatures come from a planetoid in the galacy AB84-318T. Their fur and hair conceal a slime-based anatomy (also a reason why they have little to no shoulders). Capable to make their bodies as hard or soft as they want and heal extremely fast, normal ballistic weapons are useless against them unless they’re of high caliber. Due to the composition of their bodies, they’re crippingly weak against ice. Due to their biology their size can be anything from 2 meters and up; the standard is 5-7 meters tall.

<b>Portable:</b> This laptop follows Earth’s computer designs, but it wasn’t manufactured on Earth; Rowi commissioned it and it was made in Avalon. In addition to its rock-solid stability, thanks in no small part to its strong operative system, it can connect with the Avali Nexus from almost anywhere. The band usually uses it to manage the sound of Rowi’s drumkit and synth, and to create and use audio loops during their live performances.
