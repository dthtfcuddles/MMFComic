Panel 1: Talirubi says “I got us a gig! It’s next Saturday evening in Reñaca, at the beach. This is gonna be awesome!

Panel 2: "I’ll prepare the song list and all. And Shar, please don’t forget your skills at home”. Sher narrates “My whole life I’ve been responsible because at home, if we aren’t, our whole party may die. Yet here the stress was so high that I was considering finally quitting and going back to busking”.

Panel 3: “But…” Juan is talking. “Hey Sher? I want some company. Would you take a walk with me?”. Sher says “Sure!”.

Panel 4: They’re walking across a small streetway next to a hill, with buildings behind it. “What’s up, Juan?”. “You’re a good boy, Sher, and I respect you, unlike that aweonao culiao [fucking moron] Talirubi. So I’m telling you now…”

Panel 5: “… After the gig, I’m gonna quit. I am tired of Talirubi "me me me”… and seeing how he bullies you makes me feel even more uncomfortable. I just have no idea why you put up with his bullshit". Sher replies with “I’m not surprised. And… uh… uh…”

Panel 6 we just see some ‘water’ drops falling to the ground in front of Sher’s feet.
