The first panel shows a celestial body and a spaceship going around it. The narration says "Protion had became our static home when we weren't visiting different corners of the Universe. We returned there to plan our next steps, but Sawi had something to say".

The second panel shows Sawi holding a bottle and wearing a cape. "We need to talk about something important. Let's get comfortable".

The third panel shows D and Eikomi hugging, along with Sher being hugged by Rowi. Sawi continues. "Your next gig is going to be at Wakkr'y. But you aren't going to play for the land-based species. You're being hired to play for the Unmizu, an underwater species".

The fourth panel shows Sawi that continues. "For context, the Unmizu are the creators of the EPP technology that a good part of the universe is using right now, and they are direct contributors for our translation technology. They told me they want to use your concert to tweak the translators, making them translate the lyrics youre singing faster, while ignoring the noise of your instruments.".

The last panel D says "Really? I thought translators already worked with music", and Eikomi says "Yes, but it isn't perfect if used in more extreme atmospheres, especially with long, sustained notes. From what they told us, while they can use recordings, they actually want to capture your sound live with their own technology".
