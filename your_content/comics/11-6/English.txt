Panel 1 shows a bunny being held by a horker, the bunny being all beaten up. The Horker says, with a sociopath grin, "Still giving me that defiant stare? Even tho I could rip out your guts with my bare hands?"

Panel 2 has the bunny being tossed against a wall. "You're different to all te other bunnies we've caught, I'll give you that".

Panel 3 has the horkers leaving. One asks "Why didn't you kill him, captain?" and the other replies "It would have been less fun. Besides, our Majesty wants his cattle alive".

Meanwhile the beaten up bunny is surrounded by the other bunnies. One says "I can't believe you're still conscious after being beaten up like that!". Another says "These brutes can't stand others not fearing them". Another bunny says "Why, Ruthra? Why did you decide to antagonize them and take the punishment?". The beaten up bunny replies "You don't get it, Leader. Not again. Never again".

The fifth panel shows the bunny getting up, saying "I'm never cowering again, not even for these pieces of trap gourd sap". The last panel is all black and has only words. "We're a small foraging party. Parties usually have 5 individuals. Our party has three. And why? I was already angry over the death of Rhau due to the dangers of our home... and now Byank trying to escape... And suddenly we came to discover in the worst kind of way that the not-friends from space not only are coming back to kidnap some of us... but also that they're free and happy, without having ever received any kind of punishment for what they did to us. Am I expected to just take it and hope God may punish them someday?".
