“Kauko said goodbye to their last packmate
The last survivor of a pirate invasion
Lost in the middle of the space
They did not know how to return home

They weren’t sure they wanted to return
They were the last survivor
They wanted to sit down and die
Because they were alone and miserable
Lost in space.

Help them! It’s impossible. Life is
A burden in their eyes. They cry,
Nothing makes sense.
They are the last survivor
Lost in the middle of the space
They didn’t know how to return home.”
