Panel 1: Ck'akk is downloading a video file. She says "Rowi Ouakkia proposed WHAT!?" while her aide says "Exactly as you read. I attached a copy of the livestream so you can watch it too".

Panel 2 shows Rowi saying "I want to offer you an official alliance between the Avali Illuminate, who represent the Avali Species, and Vampire Bunnies. We offer to uplift your species, to teach you and to give you all the tools...".

Panel 3 continues "...and all the technology you need so you don't just survive but also thrive on this planet. In exchange we'll want some of your natural resources. The exact terms of our alliance would be discussed and agreed upon later, if you accept it". The Horker King's eye twitches and he says "wait... WHAT?".

Panel 4 shows Sher saying "An alliance between the entire Vampire Bunny species and the Avali species? Yes, I accept it! With the Horker King as our witness I'm sure this will be good for everyone".

The last panel shows the Horker King and one of his aides. The Horker King has a frustrated expression, and he says "Okay, Sher. I'm a very benevolent ruler, and as such I recognize your freedom to make the alliances you deem right. Let's go, everyone". The aide says "But my lord, they..." and the HK says "Shut up. I said let's go".
