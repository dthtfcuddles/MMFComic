Panel 1: It shows the band from above. Sher sings: "My shiny teeth so awesome, like a Mudvayne song! My shiny teeth I wash them, so they grow so fucking strong!". The narration says "We continued playing. We were tasting success in a way we never really expected when we started. Roi and Mekari did an excellent job as roadies, but it was obvious that two weren't going to be enough. We would have to hire more roadies soon". The

panel 2 shows Mekari and Roi carrying instruments.

Panel 3 shows Sawi working with some holographic screens, while the narration continues. "Sawi, the leader of our pack, took it upon herself to help us sort our next gigs. She started investigating our next venues, telling us everything about them, and started helping us with the finances and everything. Essentially, she became our manager". Sawi says "The next location is Waulasidion, a planet in the Bayu galaxy. It's a planet with a surface covered in liquid ammonia, with some lush forests on top. They have a good relationship with the Illuminate".

The final panel shows Sher on stage talking to the audience composed of snail-like aliens with bioluminescent antennas. Sher says "Helloooo Waulasidion! What an incredible sight for a tetrachromatic bunny like me! Show me your bioluminescent ear lights! Such a beautiful sight! You're awesome!".
