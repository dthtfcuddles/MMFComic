Panel 1: The band is on a small place with two chairs looking at the sea. Rowi says “I remember it like it was last night. I had just arrived on Earth a couple days before, and I was enjoying the view of the moon, its light was reflecting on the sea just like the sun is doing right now”. D says “This is still very far away from Valparaíso for ‘just a walk’. Like… 20km [~12 miles]?”. Sher replies “Usually our foraging trips at home are at least that long if not more. This sort of distance isn’t a big deal for us bunnies”.

Panel 2: Sher continues narrating. “But yes, Rowi was sitting here. We saw each other, and he was the one who spoke first”. Rowi, in the memory, says “Oh hey, a non-human! Hello!”.

Panel 3 shows Sher. “Hi! Yeah, aliens like me aren’t a common sight around here. Most aliens I know try to look like humans. Still, happy to meet another space friend! What are you doing on a planet like this?”

Panel 4 shows just the moon and its reflection on the sea. “I came to study the musical culture of this planet. I heard it’s one of the biggest in the whole universe”. Sher replies “Oh! Such a coincidence! I’m coming back from a 'tocata’”. “What is a 'tocata’?” “Well, it is…”

Panel 5 shows the moon a lot lower and closer to the horizon. Rowi says “Earth sounds even more interesting than I thought. I may stay here for a year or so. It’s been a huge pleasure to meet you, Sher”. Sher replies with “The pleasure is mine, Rowi-Friend”. Then the narration says “We talked for several hours. Rowi was such a pleasure to talk with. Very knowledgeable, nice and… well, I could smell a soft tingle of sadness in him, but I didn’t want to pry about it”.
