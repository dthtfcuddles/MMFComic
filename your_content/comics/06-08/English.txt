Panel1:

It’s a long panel showcasing (from left to right) Kalani, Kig, Rowi, Sher, Sawi, D, Eikomi and Naha. They’re all chatting about different stuff. Kalani says “We left Kairo’s pack in charge during this month”, Rowi replies with “Good choice. Did the Illuminate approve the holiday month?”, Sawi replies with “Of course, I personally made sure of that”. Eikomi says “For some of us this is our first time in space to have fun” and Naha asks “How are you feeling, D?”. The table is filled with different plates of food for everyone, and both Sawi and Rowi are scratching Sher’s head, who has a delighted expression.

Panel 2: Mekari appears and says “Hey friends? I apologize for interrupting your family meeting, but Sher should go to the reception area now”. Rowi replies with “Thank you, Mekari” and Sawi screams “Woah! A giant cutie! aaaahhh!”.

Panel 3 has Sher and Sawi getting off the table. Sawi says “I’m going with Sher. We’ll eat our food once we return! Don’t send it back!” and Sher says “We’ll be back soon, everyone!”.

Panel 4 has both surrounded by people. Sher says “We’re here but I don’t recognize anybody”. Sawi replies with “Use your headset, cherry. It has a function to find people you have already met before”.

Panel 5 has someone screaming “There you are! I found you!!!”. Sher reacts looking behind him with a shocked expression, saying “Wait a minute! That voice! That smell!”.
