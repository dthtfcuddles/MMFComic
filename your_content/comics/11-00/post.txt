htf: Hiiiii everyone
I’ll start with the news. I’m on vacation. I’m right now in Germany, and I’m going to be attending Eurofurence. Expect me to draw either members of the band, or vampire bunnies, in whiteboards or chalkboards or stuff like that.
Now, regarding chapter 11, it was started and I hope having it done mid to late October. I hope you like it
I’ve visited this country 4 times already and I keep saying, Döner Kebab und Käsebrötchen gehören zu den leckersten Dingen, die ich je gegessen habe. Deutschland, dein Essen ist erstklassig.

Russet: It was a fun holiday in Germany! We had STEAKS and did quite a few fun things around EF
