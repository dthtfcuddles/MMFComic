Panel 1 shows Sher cutting some mushrooms, cooking. He’s singing “♪ If I was to say to you / boy we couldn’t get much higher / C’mon babe light my fire / C’mon babe light my fire ♪”.

Panel 2 is the same panel than 1 but Sher is looking to the front with a frown while the ship says “Warning! Unidentified spaceship at close distance; warp disabled”.

Panel 3 shows the trip in the pilot room. Rowi at the controls says “Yeah someone is intentionally tailing us, and it’s so close that the warp system won’t turn on. We need to find a way to get out of here right now”. Sher looks at the screen and says “Warning: Incoming. Incoming what?”.

Panel 4 shows a massive explosion at some thousands of kilometers of the spaceship. Someone says “Holy shit”.

Panel 5 shows a popup in Avali Scratch. Rowi says “Whoever this is, it’s calling us. I’ll accept the call and see what they want, and ideally to leave in peace”.

Panel 6 shows a weird alien saying “Time to introduce myself. I’m Rebitak, the pirate. Your ship and everything in it now belong to me, including yourselves. The shot I fired was failed on purpose so you could see that I’m not joking. You have 220 seconds to lower your shields. If you don’t, I’ll destroy you. It’ll be a loss, but I’m more than willing to do it”.
