Panel 1: Everyone is sitting next to a large christmas tree inside of the spaceship. While the song “Rockin’ around the Christmas Tree” plays, Mekari asks “I admit, my friends, that I have no idea what we’re doing here or what this tree means. Could you explain it to me?” Sher replies “Earth celebrates a holiday once a year named ‘Christmas’. Or, well, most of it. Some celebrate Hanukkah, some the Yule Festival and so on”. Roi says “It’s a day for giving. People give gifts to others, and try to be good”.

Panel 2: D is wearing a fake red nose. He says “The idea of 'giving’ goes beyond merely giving gifts. The idea is giving happiness; making each other happy. I used to hate Christmas due to… several reasons, but after celebrating it with Sher and Rowi, I started actually liking it”.

Panel 3: Rowi says “Oh yes, D, is there any reason in particular why you’re wearing that red nose? Is it related to the legend of "Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer”?. D replies with “mhm”.
