Panel 1 shows the Tauerk tribe in the new cave. The elder says "You helped us even though you didn't have to. We're super thankful. We accept Sher as our diplomat. We will also suggest the tribes of the Pokai and Tamber tribes to do the same".

Panel 2 the elder says "And Rowi-friend, when the previous four-ear friends came, they taught us stuff but did it in a hurry. We never got to know you Avali... and the last couple days you showed us how Avali are, and we are happy to see how important family is for you. We don't know what we would be able to do, but when the not-friends come, if you need us for anything, just ask us".

Panel 3 shows a map of the bunny area, bigger than the one in Chapter 2. "After that, we visited as many bunny villages as we could; we also mapped the entire bunny area. We knew we would need it in a future".

Panel 4 shows a bunny with an eyepatch saying "We accept you as our diplomat! and the day that damn not friend king comes, I'll be ready to slap 'im in the face with this paw! ha ha ha!" and a smaller bunny says "You go, Elder! Show 'im!". The narration says "We helped everyone we could, and in all the villages Sher's request was accepted.

Panel 5 is pitch black and the bunny eyes shine to the "camera". "Yes, Sher, you're our diplomat now. The only condition is for us to stay here, safe in the full pitch darkness". Sher replies "Super".
