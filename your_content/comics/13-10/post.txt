Moving out

Russet: Yeah... Rowi is so getting ribbed for this!
I mean the Ouakkia pack are up for helping the Bunnies but this does mean uprooting their entire life.... he is so getting so many more noogies.

htf: On the other hand... they're getting a much higher salary, more than double. If the pack was rich already, now they'll be richer. And they're climbing in the Avali social ladder even more now since they're going to be literally the pack leading the mission in a new planet. So I don't know if he'll be getting noogies. Probably some well deserved scolding though.
