Panel 1 shows "Protion, one day later". The panel shows the avali tents. Someone says "WHAT!?" and someone replies "Exactly as I said. We will be moving out in one month, we need to finish all our current tasks, and hand the ones we can't to the Fo'lon pack".

Panel 2 Eikomi says "This is huge! And scary... we've lived here in Protion ever since we left the nursery decades ago! I... I don't know if I wanna move".

In Panel 3 Sawi explains "Yes, Eiky, this is huge and a bit scary, but you know that our contract states that we could be relocated wherever the Illuminate wanted".

Panel 4 has Naha and Kig, with Naha asking "I know this is a whole new mission, and we gotta follow the Illuminate's orders. But... what big changes are coming for us besides the move?".

Panel 5 has Sawi saying "We'll have more responsibilities because we'll be leading the entire mission, including the uplifting packs thanks to Sher being part of us. This comes with more than doubling our salary, and we won't live in tents anymore but in domes".
