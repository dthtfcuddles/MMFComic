Panel 1: Roi says “I’m thankful for this chance. I’ve wanted to visit Earth again ever since I returned home 16 years ago”. D replies with “Good”.
Panel 2: Rowi says “I’m uploading an Earth Christmas film to the ship, so we can watch it together while we keep eating the holiday snacks Sher baked for us!”
Panel 3: Its a wide panel. There’s a narration box pointing at the ball-shaped snacks they’ve been eating that says “Lakriyaw Balls: They’re made by mashing the avalonian Lakriyaw fungus into a paste, then making balls with that, flour and a bit of sugar, then baking them until they roast. Their taste is a bit like vanilla biscuits with a tad of anise”. One dialog box (from the screen) says “Kevin!”, D says “Ah, I remembered why this movie annoyed me as a kid. A family so rich and big that they forgot about their son”. Rowi says “Sawi would be mortified if she was watching this”, and Roi says “At least Kevin has the house all to himself now”.
Panel 4: It shows the ship approaching to Earth. “As we approached Earth, we started thinking how much this planet meant to us, to the point we had adopted one of its biggest holidays. Sure, being ‘aliens’ we had visited many, many places. Some were just as pretty. Yet… Yet this blue planet, Earth, had claimed our hearts. It was the place we got to meet to start with! It will always be special for us. So… Happy Holidays!”
