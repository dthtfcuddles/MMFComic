Panel 1 shows an Avali ship landing, with Mekari, Roi, Sher, Rowi, D, Nau and Ki watching. The narration says "One month later an Avali spaceship arrived, carrying the Ouakkia pack and 2 other packs that would be helping to set everything up".

Panel 2 shows Sher typing on his laptop. "That's where we are right now. The packs are living in the spaceship for a few days while the builder pack, I think their name is the My'Val pack, build the homes where they're going to live. They explained to me that the weather of our planet is not good for tents like the ones they had on Protion. Instead, they are going to build domes, that are very sturdy and can resist even the loudest screams of the snow. I'm going to wrap up this diary entry for now. Maybe I'll write another one the next week unless something important happens. If I'm honest, I'm exhausted. This vacation has been very busy and stressful, and unlike humans who love getting stressed before and during their vacations, I Just wanna disappear for a few days. I know I could ask Rowi about it but my poor ball of yarn is even more stressed than I".

Panel 3 shows Sher sleeping at the table with his head on the laptop's keyboard.

Panel 4 shows the same angle, but from outside Rowi says "Honey? Are you there? Your door is open, I'm coming in!" and Sher says, with the eyes open "Ah! I'm not asleep!".
