Panel 1: The trio is greeting everyone. Sher says “Thank you for coming! We are Moumantai Mother Fuckers and we love you!”.

Panel 2: The guys are walking by the space station, with the giant Mekari directly behind them. They’re talking, Mekari is holding a big tray with Rowi’s drumkit disassembled and Sher’s guitar. Behind him there’s a drone flying with a box tied to it. D says “My new bass felt extremely good, even with the extra string. Thank you very much for it”. Rowi replies with “Not a problem! Let’s call it a late birthday gift, if you want”.

Panel 3: The ship is flying through space. The narration says “We did several shows in succession, one after the other, pretty much practicing for the ultra music festival”.

Panel 4: Sher is playing his guitar. The narration says “Sher was a bit scared, but the constant ‘practice, practice, practice’ helped him to keep his nerves on check”. Sher sings “Fool moon is on disguise and he’s on a man! and he moans! See the chainsaw in my cat”.

Panel 5: D is in their bed reading a manga while smiling, their bass next to them. The narration says “D, on the other hand, looked at peace. They weren’t acting stressed, nor were they doing the work-sleep-work schedule they did a couple months prior. They were also in a way better mood”.

Panel 6 shows Rowi using his laptop. There are some avali crystals and a bottle of jäger next to him. The narration says “I was mixing some of our new songs so we could have a new album to sell during the festival, when…”. The laptop says “1 new message” and Rowi says “huh?”.
