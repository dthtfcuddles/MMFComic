Panel 1: Sher is singing “♪ You are my light, you are my ammonia, you are the sound of a whisper spoken through a microphone with the noise suppression on 0. And when you talk about stuff that I don’t care about, when you sing that song that I despise, when you play that videogame that I dislike, I will support and hear and sing along and watch you, because I know you will do the same for me. That’s the definition of love! ♪”.

Panel 2 overtakes the whole page just showcasing an audience made of different creatures. “Make some noise, Warfaisser! How’s our cutest audience in the whole universe? The next song is about an ongoing holiday on Earth, originally from a band named Wizzard, and it’s called ‘I wish it could be Christmas everyday’! Let’s fucking go!”.

Panel 3 shows Sher singing “♪ When the snowman brings the snow, well, he just might light to know, he’s put a huge, huge smile on somebody’s faaace! If you jump into your nest, quickly cover up your head, don’t you dare lock doors because that Santa Claus is on his waaay! ♪”.
