Panel 1 shows the entire pack plus nau and Khi and Mekari watching Rowi and Sher leave. Sawi says "They'll be away for about two weeks. Meanwhile, we'll keep preparing everything here".

In panel 2 Nau asks "Sawi-friend? What are these round things? Sher said these are homes but they don't look very sturdy".

Sawi replies in panel 3. "Oh, Nau, that's because you're seeing them incomplete. When they're done they'll be extremely strong. The dome shape is designed for that".

Panel 4 shows a dome house and how it redirects wind and redistributes weight. Kalani says "Dome houses are built with stability in mind. Their weight is evenly distributed, making them strong under pressure. In addition, if they're built correctly, no matter how strong the wind may be, they aren't going to be shaken. Given this planet's weather, that's a requirement".
