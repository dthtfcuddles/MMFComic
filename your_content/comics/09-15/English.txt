Panel 1: Juan and Sher high five. Juan says “Well done! it was an excellent show!” and Sher says “Scary at first, but damn it feels nice now!”.

Panel 2: Talirubi, in tears, says “So happy for you both, celebrating how you ruined our first big gig?”

Panel 3: Talirubi puts his face close to Sher’s. “Do you think I’m going to believe your ‘errors’ weren’t intentional? You’re trying to steal the band, after all, why else would you grab the mic without permission?”.

Panel 4: Talirubi points at Juan. “And you! YOU! You were conspiring against me! I heard it myself!”. Juan replies “The fuck? Were you following us!? How insecure are you, fucking creep?”.

Panel 5: Talirubi keeps pointing, even angrier. “You know what, you traitors? I’m not giving you the satisfaction of quitting. I quit. You can keep the fucking band”. Juan replies “One centimeter closer and I’ll show you that my Warwick isn’t just to play music”.

Panel 6: Talirubi throws a mic at Sher’s face, that hits him straight up. While Sher says “ow”, Talirubi screams “Good luck trying to push this shit 'band’ forward. And fuck you both!”.
