Panel 1: Sher continues talking to his bunny audience. “The risks in outer space are different to the ones we face here. We usually don’t have to fear a bird snatching us to feed us to their babies, but there are other perils as bad or worse, like space pirates or, indeed, slavers and conquerors.

Panel 2: “In the end, what I will encourage everyone to do is, in addition to what you can to make things good for the whole species, search for your own happiness. We aren’t a powerful species. We die often and easily. And when that moment comes…”

Panel 3: “You need to be able to say the same words that a famous singer from Earth said, “I’ve lived a life that’s full; I traveled each and every highway. And more, much more than this… I did it my way”. I love you, you too, mom, dad, even if my long abscence and the fact that we’ll leave in a couple days is making you doubt of it”.

Panel 4: “And this is our final song! This is a song we made some years ago and it’s called ‘Let the dragons fly!’ Let’s have some fun!”

Panel 5: Shows the band playing from behind, and the bunny audience watching, a couple bunnies climbing a lader that give them a better view, and also Mekari and Roi at the back of the audience.
