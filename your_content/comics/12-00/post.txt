Hello, friends, and happy new year!
Chapter 12 is in the works, and if everything goes smoothly, it should start being posted mid to late February. Enjoy its cover page.
In the “real life” side of things, I’m saving money, working on stuff and yeah. Ko-fi.
There isn’t much more to add, besides that RL has been hectic the last couple months, something I did talk about when I posted the last page of the previous chapter. Luckily we wont have to wait til May for the next chapter xD
That’s about it for now. Cheers!

PS: <a href="https://mmfcomic.com/odyssey/index">Voyages of the Odyssey</a>, the story happening in MMF’s universe written by Russet (my co-writer) is being updated every Friday :3

Russet: Ahhhh more Voyages!!!!!!
