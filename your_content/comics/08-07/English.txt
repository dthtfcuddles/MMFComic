Panel 1: Both bunnies keep flying. Roi asks “What’s up, lil brother? You’re upset”. Sher replies “I… I miss you… I… I just…”

Panel 2: Sher fells off his bed. He’s in tears and just says “…”

Panel 3: It shows bunnies under the foliage of some very large bushes. The narration explains “At large, we bunnies believe in the Balance. Nature is perfectly balanced, that’s why predators exist. When we die, we "return to the land”, to be born again somewhere as another bunny, a predator, a plant… I have no idea if what we believe in is true or not… but it helps us to accept our place. And back then… all I could wish was that, if there was a Great Protector of the Balance… that they let me see Roi again.“

Panel 4: One year later, Sher and Khar are talking. Sher says "Did you hear the rumor? That the not-friends from space [horkers] were back, taking bunnies with them”. Khar replies “Yes, and it’s scary. We should tell the elders of our village as soon as we’re back”.

Panel 5: Sher is going down the ladder with a basket of fruit on his head. He says “W–w–w–wait a minute! That smell! It can’t be!”. Someone from above asks “What’s up, Sher!? Everything alright!?”.

Panel 6: It shows Sher’s tears going down his cheeks but not his eyes. He says “This… this cannot be real. Is this… another of my dreams!? I… I just… please, don’t be a dream again. Waking up is the most painful thing every single time…”
