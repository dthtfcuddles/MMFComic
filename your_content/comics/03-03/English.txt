Panel 1: Some days later, Rowi and Sher are playing videogames together. Rowi says “And what are our plans, sugar cube?”. Sher says “We’ll wait til D’s anime stuff arrives from Japan, and your crate of Jäger, then we’ll leave to Avalon to meet the pack… Hey! Was that green shell necessary?”.

Panel 2 shows the ship parked at some gas station. “Okay, we’ll stay in this service station chillin’ and resting until then”.

Panel 3 shows the trio eating pizza and watching a movie. D says “Fuck damn it, Misato! Tell the fucking kid what’s going on! I swear, watching this anime sometimes is super frustrating!”. Sher says “And having the movie solved in 45 seconds? No w– ow ahh ahh ahh” with an expression of angrily eating his pizza and burning with how hot it is. Rowi just eats in silence. The spaceship says “Attention, someone’s outside”.

Panel 4 shows Rowi talking to a delivery person. “Rowi Dänkelsaft? I hope I said it correctly. I have a delivery for you”. There’s a text explaining that the ship is parked low to comply with the law, but that its raised right now because the door is at its bottom.

Panel 5 shows Rowi and the delivery man inside of the trailer of a truck. The deliveryman says “When my boss told me that this package would be delivered to some aliens, I thought he was joking, aliens usually don’t buy stuff from us. Anyways, do you have a way to move this? Its quite heavy”. Rowi says “Yes, I have a drone, but I need to take this off the truck first. May I use your pallet jack for a moment?”.
