Panel 1: We see the ship flying. Sher asks “OK mom, dad, we’re headed to our home planet. The rest of the pack is coming in another ship, and the trip will last for around a week. What do you think about our experience now that you’ve been in space yourselves?”

Panel 2: The group are all sitting down together in a circle on top of beanbags. Khi says “The experience was way less terrible than your mom and I expected. The hardest part was to ignore our natural instincts yelling us to run away and hide, but once we met your new family it became a lot more bearable. We also saw how close you are to them, something I never saw you being with other bunnies. We knew your had made space your home, and now we understood why. The call of the void may be terrifying and both Nau and me may not like it, but we can see its appeal”.

Panel 3: Mekari says “Space is not a perfect place, but for people like us its a home we wouldn’t change. And while we gotta go back to our home planets often to settle stuff, this is where we’re happy.”

Panel 4: Khi replies “We know that now, Mekari friend, but before this event we couldn’t understand why. We were blinded by our dislike of space. Sure, we had reasons, but at least we can say we’re still learning”.
