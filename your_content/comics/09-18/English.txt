Panel 1: Someone says “I can’t believe I’m seeing you, little alien! It’s been… how long?”. Sher replies “It’s been… 17 years, ma'am. And I’m so happy to see you again…”

Panel 2: “Mrs. Benita!”. She replies with a smile “I’m so glad to see you!”.

Panel 3: Sher says “Ma'am, I promised you something, and I came to pay my debts”.

Panel 4: “I also want to introduce you both. Benita, this is Roi, my sister. Roi, this is Benita”. Roi says “Hello! How do you do”.

Panel 5: Narration goes on. “We talked for a couple hours. I repaid all the money I owed her, and I also gifted her a DVD copy of our concert at Warfaisser, with a hand-written dedication (that was Rowi’s idea) thanking her and her (rest in peace) husband Gonzalo, for helping me when I needed it the most, back when I was just a scared, shy bunny on an adventure across the stars”.
