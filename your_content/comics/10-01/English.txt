The first panel shows the band playing. Their visors are darkened, concealing their eyes like they were sunglasses. Sher says "We're delighted to be with you all here in this beautiful planet! Make some noise, Iko! The next song is from our fourth album, 'Roads of Void' and it's called 'Capabilities'! Let's go! Eins, Zwei, Polizei!".

The second panel shows the band playing for aliens with a pear shape and horns. "Our capabilities / Something we can't understand / We think we're very smart when we know nothing / We think we're idiotic fools when we know our way!".

The third panel shows a news reporter saying "The new musical space sensation, the Earth band 'Moumantai Motherfuckers', performed here on Iko, at the Queen Belanta Arena, filling it to capacity! They promised to return sometime, praising our food and the beauty of our towns!". The narration says "The Ultra Music Festival performance had changed everything for us. We were being requested and hired to play in bigger places, with larger audiences".
