Panel 1: “We started practicing. While he has given me a good impression at first, I wasn’t vibing as well anymore”. Juan says “10 cymbals, 1 hi-hat, 2 snares, no toms, 1 crash… Are you planning to play black metal?”. Talirubi replies “M…metal? HELL NO! They’re mostly for show. I use three or four of these at most. Anyways, this is a song I wrote some months ago. It’s called "the day I tripped”. Gimme a G". Sher says “G? If i recall well that was a ‘sol’”.

Panel 2: “I invested in my first electric guitar because it was going to be my "work tool”, however, since it wasn’t one of the big expensive models, Talirubi started mocking it, to the point of saying he would replace me sometime if someone came with a better one". Sher is playing while Talirubi says “Your guitar is sounding like shit again, Chair. Better fix it before the next song”. Sher continues narrating. “I was being paid, and paid well, but Talirubi was not a good boss. I put up with all his shit just because I wanted to be responsible”.

Panel 3: While the (modern) band is walking along a beach, D says “Was that experience the reason why you were so patient with me and my bs when I joined?”. Sher replies “Hmmm I want to say nah but maybe it was”.
