Panel 1 shows the ship approaching to a moon. The description says "Protion, a small moon located only 1 light year away from Avalon, it's around half the size of Earth's moon, but its rich in Gabireum, gold and kri, minerals used in the fabrication of nanocomputers and processors, along with micronuclear reactors. It's inhabited by a moderate sized group of Avali colonies".

Panel 2 has D saying "Okay, I should be ready. My EPP is set to frigid and the translator in my ear rings is set up to Avali". Sher says "You shouldn't have issues with breathing either, but like always, if you have any issues, just touch my ear and I'll bring you back here".

Panel 3 Rowi says with a smile "Finally, we're here. We will land in 3 minutes and 30 seconds".

Panel 4 shows the Iron landing properly on a platform. "Once we land, we gotta walk around 500 meters to where my pack usually works. They know we're coming".
