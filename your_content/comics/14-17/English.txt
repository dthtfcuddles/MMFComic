Panel 1, "The next morning", shows the stage being built by several Avali, using drones to help. Mekari and Roi are helping as well. Sawi says "This is the stage so far. It will be ready in a week and half".

Panel 2 D says "This looks so fancy and cool! We never had a large stage built from scratch just for us, we always used stages that already existed or improvised something very small to perform, usually at some corner in a space station. What are these shiny black panels?". Eikomi replies "They're 3D projectors. They, well, project images around everyone. It's awesome! It's like you're dancing in a sea of colors! These are used in rave parties on Avalon".

Panel 3 has Rowi smiling and saying "You can always count on Sawi. I told her we wanted to give bunnies an amazing huge show like we have never done before, and she knew exactly what I meant". Sher says, with a shocked expression "H...holy shit, our first custom large stage is... this!? Daaamn this is awesome! I... I have no words!".
