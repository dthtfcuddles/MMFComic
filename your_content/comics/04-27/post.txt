Final page of Chapter 4.

Not gonna lie, this chapter was one of the most fun I’ve had drawing comics in eons. A lot of things happened not just in the plot (that is finally moving forward) but also regarding the development of this piece.
I hope you liked it. While this is a personal work, I also got some help from some peeps (you can check them in the credits section) and I feel that thanks to them this comic is shaping to be something even better than I envisioned it at first.

Chapter 5 will start coming sometime in May, and is going to be a lot shorter than this one. That’s mainly about it, though. Thank you very much for reading this comic, I appreciate it! And see you then!
