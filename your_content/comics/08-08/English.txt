Panel 1: Roi is there wearing a London beanie. She says “Hi, little brother!”.

Panel 2: Sher pounces at her saying loudly “ROI!”.

Panel 3: The narration says “Roi was alive! And she had a lot of stories to tell”. Roi is telling a group of bunnies “… then I boarded that vessel. It took me to a place with a lots of aliens of different shapes and colors. Everyone was so friendly”.

Panel 4: Narration says “Mom, however, wasn’t too thrilled”. Nau says “Stop, Roi! Friendly aliens? Beautiful space? This is all nonsense! 85 years ago aliens nearly killed us all, you could’ve led them here! Is that what you want? You aren’t my Roi anymore. Whatever you saw, it changed you, for the worse. Stop it!”.

Panel 5: Roi is in tears saying “What!? How could you even begin to imagine I’d ever want something like that?”. Nau says “Listen to yourself! Look at what you’re saying after what we all went through!”. The narration says “I never doubted Roi. I knew she was being honest, but the others thought differently. I guess because nobody had gotten as close to her as I had done. Nobody knew her as I did”.
