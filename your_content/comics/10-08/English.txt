The band is performing. In panel 1 it shows the stage (actually rather small). D is holding their bass guitar, Rowi is at his drumkit, with his right arm up holding the drumsticks, and Sher with both hands up. Sher says "Hello, Wakk'ry!". The audience is a lot of Unmizu that are in water up to their chests.

Panel 2 shows a lot of unmizu lifting their hand-paws and celebrating while spilling some water.

Panel 3 shows Rowi playing from behind, with the light making Sher and D look like only silouettes. Sher is singing "I've been through planets! I've visited asteroids! I've been to hostile worlds, and I'm proud of what I am! If you don't like it, you can go fuck yourself!".

Panel 4 shows Roi and Mekari watching the show from a side, while four other Unmizu are taking notes on laptops and tablets and watching with special dark visors, two of them with antennas. The lyrics say "Ich verstehe nicht, warum du traurig bist, wenn dieses Land so ruhig und entpannt ist, du solltest nicht traurig sein, well du hier lebst, ich liebe es, hier zu sein ganz erlicht!" (Translation: "I don't understand why you're sad, when this land is so peaceful and relaxed. You shouldn't be sad because you live here. I truly love being here!").
