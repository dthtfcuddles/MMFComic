Panel 1: “Babupekkakerok, 16 years ago…” Sher and Roi are in what looks like a forest, gathering fruit in the shadows. Sher says “Delicious berries, no dangerous plants around… this place is a jackpot!”. Roi replies with “Yes, but stay vigilant, brother, we must sharpen our skills if we wanna join a foraging party in a future”.

Panel 2: Sher says “I’m not sure I want to… Wait! Roi! Is that a Shadow-wing? I’m scared now!”. Roi replies with “I see it. Don’t panic. Let’s stay close to each other. If it comes at us, we spread out.

Panel 3: It shows a winged creature with enormous claws. One of them says "I don’t think it has seen us yet. Don’t move”.

Panel 4: Sher says “The Shadow-wing is leaving”. Roi replies with “I wish we didn’t have to live scared of everything like this. Maybe living in a new place?”

Panel 5: It shows the duo holding a lot of berries, Roi holding a basket and Sher using his hat, talking to a group of other bunnies in a cave. Roi says “We found a great berry place!”, Sher says “It’s in the direction of the old bark with the red snapping death, you can reach it in half a morning’s walk”. Khar, one of the bunnies, says “We were considering going in that direction tomorrow. Thank you for the information, friends!”. Another bunny, Kwai, says “We brought some cinati fruit earlier. You can take some of it too!”.
