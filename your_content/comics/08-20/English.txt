Panel 1: Sher is staring at Viña del Mar’s Reloj de Flores. He says “Woah! Roi never told me of anything like this! With… numbers? Yeah, I’m sure these are numbers! I wonder what the sticks are for?”. The narration says “I got off the bus at the entrance of a city next to Valparaíso named "Viña del Mar”. And the very first thing I saw was a very nice sculpture made with flowers and grass. Not only was it incredible to see it in person, but…“

Panel 2: Sher is looking at Valparaíso at a distance shortly after the night began, saying "All these lights! All these colors! This is amazing!”. The narration says “… walking around, without fear, I could see with my own eyes what a tamed planet looked like. A planet where you could be free, without having to fear every single beast in the sky or on the land. And I felt the same urges Roi had to tell everyone else in our village what we had experienced. This was the beginning of a new life for me. I wasn’t sure if I would return home in one year or two, but I knew I wanted to experience the joy, the fun and all the things I didn’t know existed until my dearest sister started talking about them after her return. Earth, I am Sher and I am here to get the best of you!”.
