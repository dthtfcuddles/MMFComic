Finally, this chapter is uploaded and I couldn’t be happier with it. It’s everything I wanted to be and more. It let me not only talk about Sher’s backstory but also expand on the vampire bunny society and lifestyle.

Thank you so much for reading it, this means a lot.

Chapter 9 should come mid February. See you then!

And remember, every Monday we’ll get a new chapter of the Voyages of the Odyssey!

Russet: Ahhh <a href="/MMFComic/voyages/">Voyages of the Odyssey!</a> You don't have to read it to read the comic but if you want to see more of our world it really does help explore the behind the scenes!
