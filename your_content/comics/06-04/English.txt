Panel 1: The band is sitting at a table, talking. Rowi says “I was reviewing the info I got about our performance. We have 3 hours. We’re also allowed to cover any songs we wish. So.. what is our tracklist going to be?. Sher says “I’d say that to have a base list, everyone can pick 3 songs from each album and if two of us pick the same, we add it”. And D replies with “That’s a great idea!”.

Panel 2: Sher says “But… in addition to the 3 songs I’ll pick, I want to play one that’s very relevant for me now, ‘Cattle’. Rowi replies with “Woah, dear, I didn’t expect you to pick that one… but it makes sense”.

Panel 3: D replies with “I’m absolutely down for it, as long as your hatred doesn’t end with you puking your guts out again”. Sher replies with “I… I won’t do it this time. I promise”.

Panel 4 shows Rowi and D trying to comfort Sher who’s on his knees on top of a puddle of vomit, with Sher’s guitar laying at a side. Sher is gasping and sobbing while saying “born… to die…”. The narration explains “D refers to something that happened in 2017 shortly after we had released our ‘Coordinates’ album. Sher got overwhelmed by his hate during that song and screamed so strongly that he ended vomiting. It wasn’t a nice sight. It ended being the first and last time we had done this song live. ‘Cattle’ was the only song that we had back then that talked about what vampire bunnies had gone through. It was also a good song choice for this festival, given our decision to tell what happened to the rest of the universe, but we had reasons to be concerned about playing that track live”.
