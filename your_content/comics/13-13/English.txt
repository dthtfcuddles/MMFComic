Panel 1 shows some Avali working in a dome in the background, using a drone as a helper. Sawi, with a very serious expression talks to Rowi and Sher. "Listen to me. I've noticed how exhausted you are. Nau and Khi came to talk to me about ir as well, so, as of today, I'm kicking you both off the planet. You'll both be taking a small break from all the stuff here".

Panel 2 shows Rowi and Sher, Rowi has a resigned expression. He says "Sawi...". Sher asks "I... um... okay sister, you are right, I'm exhausted, but... what do you mean by kicking Rowi, D and me out?".

Panel 3 shows D hugging Eikomi's shoulder with one hand. D says "Oh no, I'm not leaving, this is a small vacation just for you two lovebirds".

Panel 4 shows Sawi talking again (with the construction work behind her). "As the leader of this pack, it is my duty to take care of everyone's health and safety. Rowi knows this side of me well; I sent him to Earth back in the day, and I'm not going to flinch if I have to do it again. You can pick wherever you're going, or I can pick for you. But it has to happen now, while we're just setting up and don't need you here. You'll leave tomorrow morning".

Panel 5 has Sawi staring at Rowi and Sher who look back at her. Rowi just says "...Okay, sister".
