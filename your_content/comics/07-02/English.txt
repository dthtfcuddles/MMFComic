Panel 1: Eikomi, Sawi, Naha and Nau are there. Eikomi says “M…my head almost moves by itself! How do they do that?”. Sawi replies with “Their music is very catchy, I think thanks to the 4/4 time signature that they’re using a lot. We Avali rarely do that”.

Panel 2: Roi is on top of Mekari’s head. She asks “What is a time signature?”. Mekari replies “It’s the count of how many pulses a bar has”. Roi asks “What is a bar?” and Mekari says “When you write music, you separate the notes in small groups of beats. These are named "bars”.

Panel 3: Shows Rowi playing the drums, along with the tablature of a simple rhythm. Mekari continues “The time signature is what indicates how many beats a bar will have. 4/4 means 4 beats per bar. There’s more to it but this is the most I can simplify it”.

Panel 4 shows Roi upside down, while her hat is falling down. She says “Amazing! Do you write music, meky goo?”.

Panel 5 shows Roi still on Mekari’s head, but staring at him. Mekari replies “Nah, I’m just repeating what your brother tried to teach me once”.
