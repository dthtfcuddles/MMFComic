Panel 1: One of the bunnies mentions "Huh, the soil is very soft" and a second one says "huh, true".

Panel 2 shows all the bunnies falling into a hole trap, while a portable grid that was covered with leaves compacts itself.

Panel 3 shows the bunnies in a hole while two horkers (one holding the portable grid trap) talk. One says "ehehe look, these idiots fell into the hole too". Another says "For living underground they don't know much about holes, huh?".

Panel 4 shows a spaceship in the middle of the space

Panel 5 shows both horkers looking at a group of bunnies behind a crystal. The bunny says "Heeey, let us go! That was unfair!". One of the horkers say "These three complete our bunny quota, the king will reward us handsomely!". The other horker say "A couple don't look very scared. Let's torture them into submission".
