Panel 1 shows a space station with trees and plantations. Narration says "Goldentraf Space Station, WWH-4930 Galaxy ISBB-4938031. Distance: 128 Billion light years away from Earth, just 2 million kilometers away from the Greenstock Nebula". D says "Okay, let's recap. Right now we're headed to Avalon. We'll stay there for a couple weeks while Rowi does his job. Then we'll go for Mekari, who has been on his home planet helping his family and friends. Then we'll head to ST-B886 with a message requesting a rescue. Is that right?".

Panel 2 shows the trio eating food. Rowi says "Not to Avalon itself, but to a moon where my pack is working right now. But during our stay I'll go to Avalon to buy some things".

Panel 3 shows a billboard in standard galactic alphabet. "Try our unique recipes! Vegetarian ice cream with flufftail. Enjoy the most delicate flavor, with a beautiful view to the close nebula". Someone says "mmm... ice cream, why not?".

Panel 4 a server that looks like a snail says "Hello! Did you like the food?". Rowi says that it was great in Avali, Sher says "Yes!" in Bunny Song, and D says "Super good!" in German.

Panel 5 D says "I want another serving, and ice cream too. Charge it to my account". Sher says "Yeah, I want the same as my friend too". The server says "Right away".
