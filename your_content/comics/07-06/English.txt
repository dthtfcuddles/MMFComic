Panel 1: The only thing being focused with the lights is Sher. He starts. “There was a time when life was hard. There was a time when we all died, our flesh cut, our skin torn. Why? Why did you do that”

Panel 2: He’s singing while playing the guitar softly. “♪ In the dark I can’t forget experiences, family. Shits didn’t care for us all, they wanted our flesh to sell ♪”

Panel 3: Everything lights up while Rowi is assaulting the drumkit at fast speed.

Panel 4: Sher is screaming. “♪ You weren’t even from home! What? What do you mean? Seeing us as cattle? Fuck, fuck you well fucked! You have no idea what it is being born to die! Born to die! Born to die! ♪”.

Panel 5: Roi, still standing on Mekari’s head, with her fur fluffing up in stress, says “Brother? What the fuck?”. Mekari asks “Huh? What’s up, Roi?”.
