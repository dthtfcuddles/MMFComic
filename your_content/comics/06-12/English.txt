Panel 1: Naha, Kalani, Sher, Nau, Khi, Roi, Rowi, D and Eikomi are sitting at the table. Everyone has empty plates in front of them. Sawi is at the other side of the tablet, speaking in Vampire Bunny Song (vampire bunny’s native language). She says “The reason why you felt the invitation in your head is because the organizers of this event are a telepathic species. I wouldn’t worry so much. Anyways, since we finished our lunch, I suggest we go back to our rooms”. Eikomi replies with “Yes” in Avali core.

Panel 2: Khi asks Sawi “You speak our language very nicely. Did Sher teach it to you?”.

Panel 3: Sawi replies: “Chirp! Thank you! Yes, he did, but not in the way you think. Cherry kindly let me snag a copy of the language file residing in his visor that he’s been building for years. The processor in my head helped me to learn it in an hour or so”.

Panel 4: Its a long busy panel that shows Naha, Roi, Sher, Rowi, Nau, Khi, D, Eikomi and Sawi walking. Sher and Rowi are holding hands. Sher says “Hey sweetie? Could we call Mekari and take a big group photo?”. Rowi replies with “Of course, my rolling wheel of cheese! I’ll tell everyone”. Roi says “Wait! Did you say ‘Mekari’? Is he here!?”. Khi says “This is not as bad as I thought. If I was younger i could even end up liking this. Our son is really lucky”. (Nau is looking at him with a concerned expression). Eikomi is complaining to Sawi. “Oh come oooon sis! That’s cheating! I wanted to learn bunny too! But it’s hard!”. Sawi replies “Just get the same augments I did! Easy! I’m not cheating; just using the tools I have available”.
