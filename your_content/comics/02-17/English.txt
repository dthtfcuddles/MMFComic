Panel 1 has Rowi hugging Sher. The Avali says “Don’t beat yourself too hard, my pizza roll. You know better than anybody that writing under stress is hard as fuck. Don’t. Instead, I have a better idea for our next performance”. Sher says “huh?”.

Panel 2 has D entering the scene, with the door opening for them. D says “I think Rowi and me are thinking the same, let’s just play instrumental songs. Let the instruments do the talking. Auuugh *yawn*”

Panel 3 shows Sher with a shocked face, saying “Of course! I’m an idiot! ‘Let the instruments do the talking’! Why didn’t I think about this before?”

Panel 4 shows Rowi leaving the room and saying “Think about the songs you want us to play and tell us later. Remember we need to practice them. Love you”.

Panel 5 shows Sher sitting in his beanbag and saying “Spaceship, create a new playlist. Add the following songs: “Played-a-live”, “Stratosphere”, “Quadrophenia”, “Orion”, “Wizards in Winter”, “Memphisto” from Depeche Mode, the “Love theme from Flashdance” and “Miasma” from Ghost, then stream it to my headset”. The ship AI replies with “10 command(s) added succesfully to the queue. Executing now…”

Panel 6 has Sher asking Rowi (who is eating ramen) “Hey honey? May I use your drumkit?”. Rowi replies with “Of course. Just remember to make a backup of the settings before changing anything”.
