Panel 1: D is in a graveyard. He says “…And that’s what’s been going on. I even got a space sister, one that actually acts way less spoiled than your daughter in spite of having much more”.

Panel 2: D smells a handful of flowers with their eyes closed.

Panel 3: D drops the flowers next to the gravestone of ‘Emma Reh’ with an epitaph in German: 'Der Tod, so bitter er auch sein mag, ist nicht das Ende, sondern nur eine weitere Stufe, von der aus wir zu einem besseren Leben übergehen’. D says “You know what, old hag? I forgive you for all the bullshit. To be honest, I’m sorry you never found happiness in your life; unlike what you taught me, I learned that life actually can be beautiful and worth living. I don’t really love you, but I genuinely hope you found some peace at the end, and that you’re having fun with all your boys down there. Now it’s my time… to leave with my new family, or pack, as we call ourselves. And you… You sleep well or whatever. Auf Wiedersehen wir sehen uns in der holle”.

Panel 4: The band is walking through a street, but both Sher and Rowi are hugging D. Rowi says “Hey D, you’re still very stressed. Wanna get some Döner Kebab with us?”. D replies “S…sure! Thank you guys. You’re the best thing that has happened to me in my life”.

Panel 5: Roi, standing on a ceiling, wearing a visor, says “We love you too, D. You can be sure of that”. There’s a small narration square saying “End of recap. Thank you for reading this intermission. The story will resume in Chapter 8”.
