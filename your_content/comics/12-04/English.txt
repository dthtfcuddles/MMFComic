Panel 1 shows the band next to 5 bunnies who have a cart full of fruit. Sher says "You recognized us right away, woah. Hey!". One of the bunnies say "Of course, and you being here makes us feel even safer than before. Will you come home with us?". Another bunny says "shhh, we're still in the open. Lower your voices, guys". A third one says "Hi, D! We're so happy to see you again!". Another bunny says "Welcome home!". Two of the bunnies are holding avali spears.

In panel 2 there's a forest view. Sher says "Okay, friends. A cart? Spears? Where did you get these from?". A bunny says "Some four-ear friends from space came and gave them to us so we could defend ourselves". Rowi says "Interesting. Not only was Sawi right, but they did a lot more than just... learning about you". Another bunny ask "Who's Sawi?".

The next panel has the same panel of Sawi eating fries from chapter 7, where she says "I got news that the Illuminate wants to learn about your species, and apparently they're planning to send a pack to your planet. Usually this means sending a diplomat to learn about your society, your customs, etc. And while I wasn't told this, I'm sure they will be very interested in learning about what horkers did to your people". Sher says then "She's my space sister, our pack leader".

Finally a panel shows the nighttime with two moons. Sher says "Okay, let me put everything in order, because right now my thoughts are very spread around. Basically, last year, an Avali pack came here. That pack came to learn about us bunnies, however, they didn't just do that. They gave you weapons and tools". A bunny replies with "Exactly! They taught us how to defend against predators and made it much easier to get food and to store it". Sher replies "Now I get it. I knew they would come. I even know a friend from that pack. I just didn't know they would start uplifting us".
