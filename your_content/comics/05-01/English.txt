Panel 1: Auz’us (Character from chapter 3) is in some sort of cell, locked up. He’s sitting down, resting or meditating. The walls are made of broken stone along with the floor.

Panel 2: The cell door opens. MX-110 (the robot who received the band in Chapter 3) is there. He says “It’s time, meatbag”.

Panel 3: Auz’uls says while frowning “Time fo what? To make me fix your stupid weapons that will kill everyone on this planet?”. MX-110 replies with a dry “No”.

Panel 4: MX-110 says “We don’t need you and havent needed you for months, actually. This is going to be your last walk through this place”.

Panel 5: Auz’uls says “So what? Are you going to execute me now?”. MX-110 replies “I would like it, but no”.
