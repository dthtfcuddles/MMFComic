Panel 1 shows D and Eikomi watching anime in D's room, with a large soda tank and a sort of microwave with multiple rectangular/squared pizzas in it. The narration says "...Anime. The one good thing that has accompanied me through my entire life". The TV is playing "Daichi o fumishimete, kimi wa mezameteiku, tenshi no hohoemi de, tsuderashite!". D says "We're about to start the Greed Island arc. Any thoughts?". Eikomi replies "That Hisoka guy is a creep! I wouldn't want him near me".

Panel 2 shows Eikomi raising her arms while the TV says "I need your energy to defeat Majin Boo!". Eikomi says "You can have mine, Goku!".

Panel 3 shows Mitty crying on D's arm and covering it in tears while saying "Mitty...!".

Panel 4 shows the house from outside, being dark but with a full moon. D says "Okay, Eiky. We've been here for 3 days just watching random anime. Let's take a break and we can resume in a few days. I'm not leaving anytime soon, anyways". Eikomi says "Hmmm... I agree with you. I'm off to my own room. And... Daniel? I enjoyed this a lot. Like, a big lot".
