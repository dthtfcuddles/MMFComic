Panel 1: The two aliens are Mekari and another from their same species. Mekari explains, “Okay, we won’t delay you anymore. She’s my sister, Tarasi. We want you to play a concert for our clan. Your music would boost our morale by a lot”. Tarasi says “Good morning” in their language.

Panel 2: It shows the lake. Meanwhile Rowi says “We can do it without any problem, but, why so secretive? Why not ask us when we were at the space station or something?”. Mekari replies with “Well, it’s because we are hiding here. We didn’t want to leave our mark anywhere. We can’t even show ourselves here too much”.

Panel 3: The explanation continues, they’re in a dark cave. “We aren’t native to this planet. We came here escaping from a group of wars that happened on ours. The mice who rule here are very tribalistic and distrustful of strangers”. Rowi is sitting down with Sher resting his back against Rowi’s chest and tummy. Rowi says “Lemme see if I got this correctly. You escaped from the wars on your planet, settled here and want us to play our music for you?”.
