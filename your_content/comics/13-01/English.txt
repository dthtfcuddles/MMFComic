Panel 1: It shows three avali sleeping on a large mattress on the floor, one of them is holding a plush. A fourth avali says "Miss Ck'akk? Please wake up, it's important. Miss Ck'akk! Get up, I say!". Ck'akk (the one holding the plush) asks "huh? What's up, Karu?".

Panel 2 shows Ck'akk drinking a coffee while wearing her cape. She asks "Couldn't it wait 2 more hours or something?" and Karu replies "No, ma'am. While this happened a few hours ago, Sawi Ouakkia is waiting for a video call with you".

Panel 3 shows a building. Ck'akk asks "What happened? Can't you give me a brief, at least?". Karu replies "Okay, ma'am. Remember MMF? The music band with a vampire bunny who wanted to become a diplomat?". Ck'akk replies "Yes, I do. What's up with him?".

Panel 4 shows a ship flying towards an Illuminate building. "Well, his first job as a full diplomat for his people was to trample on the Horker King's plans, setting up an alliance". Ck'akk replies "An alliance? WHAT!? How did it happen!?"
