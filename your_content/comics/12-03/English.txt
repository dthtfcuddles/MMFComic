Panel 1 shows the Avali and Sher. Sher says "According to my visor, you're Seinu. That's why you know me... You're from the Trail Pack, my sister Sawi told me about them. Our packs have been working together to build your spaceship, a very fancy one". Seinu replies with "Yep, that's me and that's my pack. I knew your pack had a vampire bunny among them, but I never saw you with them before".

Panel 2 shows Sher saying "You seem to know a lot about my family. Tell me about yours?". Seinu says "It's hard not to, your family is the highest ranked mining pack in Protion. Anyways, we're a diplomatic pack, meeting alien governments, talking trade agreements and all that".

Panel 3 goes back to the present time. D, Sher and Rowi are walking. D says "... and that avali diplomat was the one sent here to learn about your species, right? That's a very convenient coincidence. Maybe you could contact him and ask him to teach you how to be a diplomat". Sher says "Yeah I was thinking the same. I need to catch him when he's not very busy". Rowi says "I had forgotten completely about this. Honey, you're an insanely lucky bunny, you're getting all the tools to truly protect your species at a galactic level, something many others can only dream about".

Panel 4 has D asking "Why did we park the ship so far away from Sher's home town?" and Rowi replies "Safety. If horkers send scouts and they find our ship, we won't be guiding them to Sher's home".

The last panel has someone offscreen saying "Sher!? Rowi!? D!? Hey guys! Welcome back!".
