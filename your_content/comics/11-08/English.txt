Panel 1: The bird alien and Ruthra are getting out of the ship's room. Ruthra says "We'll see if we can find more prisoners and then we'll come back". His party leader says "Stay safe, Ruthra".

Panel 2 shows the bird interacting with a computer. "I'm forcing all the doors to stay open. We need to get all the prisoners together to teleport them out". Ruthra replies with "I don't understand any of what you're saying, but I trust you, friend-with-beak".

Panel 3 shows a horker shadow. Both Ruthra and the bird look at it. Ruthra says "HEY! It's you! You won't hit me again!". The bird says "Oh, captain K'ark, what do you want? I can finish the job if killing you, if you want it so much".

Panel 4 shows the horker, hurt and slightly bloody. He says "Do you think you're so superior just because you're pillaging and stealing our cattle? Please. There's a saying i heard once... 'Whoever has the last laugh, has a better laugh'".

Panel 5 shows him holding something like a remote while he smirks. He says "...I hope you, your crew and all these bunnies we caught enjoy their last 4 seconds of life".

The last panel shows the bird panicking. "Dauz here! Code 5! Teleport out! NOW! Code 5! Code 5!".
