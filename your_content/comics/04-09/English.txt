Panel 1 shows Sher wearing the headset. "They feel super comfy in my ear, but it feels weird not to have a screen in front of my eyes". Eikomi says "Turn them on, Cherry".

Panel 2 Sher says "Oh, okay. Gotta... WOAH" right when a visual screen appears in front of his eyes.

Panel 3 Sher says "This is awesome! The HUD is less intrusive and everything feels much more natural! Thank you! Thank you so much!".

Panel 4 Kalani tells D "I apologize if the gift wasn't the best. Sadly I could only go for what Rowi had told us about you and this was the best I could come up with". D says "W--what do you mean? I love it! I'm just... not used to receiving gifts".

Panel 5 Eikomi is holding a laptop while she says "Then you'll have to get used to it, cutie. This is yours too".

Panel 6 shows the laptop screen. D says "A laptop like Rowi's? What the heck?". Eikomi says "I set it up so the system is in 'Human language'. I hope this is right". D replies "This is English, I can use this just fine. Thank you so much. I.. just... Ah".

Panel 7 D covers half of his face. "You mother fuckers. I'm not going to play the 'Though guy' act. You're way more than anything I would ever deserve and I'm in tears. When I joined this band I just wanted to find some value on myself, to make myself worth my existence. To know I'm not the parasite my mom said I was. Yet... you don't know me and still bring me gifts. I... thanks".
