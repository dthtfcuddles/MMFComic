Families and Packs

Russet: Nau & Khi are very traditional bunnies and very much dislike the idea of having a kid then just abandoning it. Not because you are ill or have no choice but just straight up walking out on them.
htf: More than "traditional", I'd say that it's the opposite to "The Bunny Way". And it's an interesting angle that will be explained in due time, considering how due to the dangers of their planet, bunny society is relatively desensitized to bunnies dying to the perils of "The Land".
