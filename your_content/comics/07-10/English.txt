Panel 1: Sher is waking up. He thinks “I’m awake… was that a dream?”

Panel 2: He sits down while he puts on his headset. “Uaaaagghh… how long did I sleep?”

Panel 3: Sher turns on his visor and reads text in Avali Core. “1 new message from Rowi. ‘Hey honey, when you wake up come to the Teshari restaurant in sector 4-KW. Love you’”.

Panel 4: Sher yawns again. “Uaaahh okay honey, I’ll go. Damn I’m exhausted”

Panel 5 is a big panel showing a two-stories aisle and some trees and lots of other aliens, with him walking in the middle. “Everything felt surreal. Like our huge show had been just a dream, even if I knew it had been real. I was beyond exhausted. I had slept for more than 23 hours. The stress that I had accumulated for months was gone, and my body had decided that it just wanted to relax and sleep”.
