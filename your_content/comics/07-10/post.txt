When I wrote that text conversation I considered going over the top, but ended grounding it a bit. And even tho I feel it's still a bit exaggerated, I got some comments telling me that it was a very creepy toxic one and actually realistic to an extent. I don't know if feeling proud or dirty for such accomplishment.
