Russet: Why are their furry people on Earth? Like D and Juan? Alien technology, It's called Bio-Sculpting and was quite popular in the 60s & 70s with people who wanted to change their appearance. It is also genetic so will get passed onto your children.

htf: Correction: in the 80s, the 60s and 70s aliens hadn't been shown to humans yet. I feel I should explain this properly in a future comic chapter haha
