Panel 1: “One night I was coming back home after attending another gig, when I saw a very simple piece of paper taped to a wall under a bridge”.

Panel 2: “It was just another flashy coincidence. In any other moment I wouldn’t even have noticed it, but this piece of paper would change my life”. (The paper says “Rock band being formed. I’m building a rock band, and guitar, bass and piano are welcome! Call me to (32) xx xxxxx or talk to me at talirubi_xx[at]hawtmail.com”)

Panel 3: Sher asks Rowi via IM “Do you think I should go for it, Rowi-Friend? I mean, I can play the guitar but I have no idea if I’m actually good”. Rowi replies “For sure! I mean, you already kind of do it for a living, right? Joining a band is, in a way, a more advanced form of busking”.

Panel 4: A weasel-like character says “I’m Talirubi and yes! I want to form a rock band!”. The narration says “I was surprised when I learned that the person wanting to form a rock band was not a human. Talirubi looked very friendly and he had a way with words. He made me feel at ease at first”.

Panel 5: A sort of spotted bunny or dog with floppy ears, a “Los Mox” shirt and a Warwick bass is there. Narration says “The other friend who joined us was Juan. He was a college student, fan of the band "Los Mox” and he told us he was joining us mainly to shut his dad’s mouth who was fond of yelling at him how he was ‘doing nothing’ with his instrument and then ranting about his grades. 'I can’t really say anything, he’s paying for my career’, he explained".

Panel 6, narration says “But truth be told, I should’ve seen the writing on the wall from the beginning”. Talirubi says “Okay, we never got a pianist, but that’s fine. I will hire you for this band named 'Talirubi and his gang’. And Shor, please change that geriatic piece of wood you’re carrying for a proper electric guitar, please”. Sher says “HEY!”.
