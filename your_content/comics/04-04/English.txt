Panel 1 has the band at the surface of the moon. Some Avali work in the background. Rowi says "It feels so nice to be here! Even the feel of the air touching your face has that home vibe. Damn, being here is nice". D says "I can see in your face how much you missed this place". Sher says "I can't wait to meet the pack again. I hope everyone's doing well".

Panel 2 shows a rac of servers in a tent. "While technologically we're extremely advanced compared to Earth, we are a nomad species, and as such, our workplaces usually feature tents that can easily be moved around, in addition to our standard 'bedroom' tents. We do have some permanent settlements, but they're uncommon and only on our home planet."

Panel 3 shows the trio reacting, with someone saying behind them "That's right, but you should tell them that our 'home planet' isn't a planet, but actually a moon".

Panel 4 shows an Avali with spiky hair and cheeks. He says "Rowi, Sher and... you must be D, right? Welcome to Protion!". A small blurb says "Naha (Mechanic). Easygoing and nice, loves videogames and has a small collection of them. His motto is 'Don't take life too seriously, you won't get out of it alive anyways".
