Panel 1 says "A few days later..." and shows two horkers. One says "C-Captain? There's a pirate ship and... and...", the other says "They're about to teleport here! We can't stop it!".

Panel 2 shows three pirates (one of them being the same bird shown in the previous chapter and in earlier pages of this one) teleporting in. The bird says "You know the drill. Neutralize all the horkers and release any prisoners you find". A bunny pirate says "Yes, captain!".

Panel 3 shows essentially the UI of the game "FTL: Faster than Light", with the Horker ship being the player one and the pirate ship being the enemy. There's a "intruders detected" signal.

Panel 4 shows a door exploding with a large flame coming in.

Panel 5 shows the bird standing next to the glass of the vampire bunny "cage" and placing something that looks like a mechanical spider on the glass. The pirate says "Hey little friends, we're on your side. Stay away from the glass, it's going to shatter and I don't want you to get hurt". Ruthra asks "Who are you?".
