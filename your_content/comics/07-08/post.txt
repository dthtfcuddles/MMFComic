Russet: 8th August 2023, that's the day Vic originally posted this comic.
It's also the day Vic appeared in my DMs and asked me to be his co-writer. It'd been commenting and talking and enthusing his ear off about MMF for about 8 months by this point.
I was not expecting to be asked, but I was honoured to say yes. I love this comic, the world Vic and I guess by extension I have helped to create. I love talking MMF lore and through it I found family too!
Found family is a big, huge massive theme for us in the story and well I found Vic! My crazy big huge bunny brother <3
So this comic will always be super special.

htf: Bringing you here was the absolute best decision I ever made. <3
