Panel 1: Sher, with his makeup very runny and looking at D, says “The last song of the night is a tune from our second album, and it’s called "Let the dragons fly”. Thank you so much guys".

Panel 2: Shows Rowi spinning his drumsticks with the hands.

Panel 3: Roi says “I admire how my brother can jump from creepy to cheery and happy and make it feel natural. Hey mekygoo, your body is cold”. Mekari replies “Of course. I’m a slime, after all”

Panel 4: The band is posing while they play the last notes of their song. The narration says “Our last song (an instrumental) was the best for closing the most intense concert we had ever done. For real, we were used to playing one and half hours at most, and this one lasted the whole three hours we had been assigned”.

Panel 5 is a wide panel. It shows the audience and the band from behind, the three hugging with one hand and looking to the audience; D is lifting their bass and Rowi their drumsticks. Rowi says “We love you! Stay safe and take care of yourselves! Thank you very fucking much! See you next time!”. D says “Und ein besondered dank geht an unsere Familie! Unsere riesige Familie, die für uns da war! Vielen dank! Bis zum nächsten Jahr!” [And a special thanks to our family! Our huge family who has been there for us! Thank you! See you next year!].
