Panel 1: The ship is landing. Sher says “According to the ship’s AI this is ‘Lake Wirnau’, but this looks way too tiny to be a lake”. Rowi replies with “Maybe it got the name from when this was bigger. I’ve seen that happen before”.

Panel 2: Sher has shiny sparkly eyes and he says “This is… the most beautiful dawn I’ve ever seen in my life!”. Rowi responds “Oh come on, my ice cream, you always say the same” and Sher replies to that with “but… but… aaaahhh!”. Then a small bubble explains that Vampire Bunnies have tetrachromatic vision.

Panel 3: Shows a sunrise. Sher says “I know you can’t see the colors, but dear, believe me, they are so nice… so nice!”.

Panel 4: Some aliens say “We love these sunrises too. Sadly we can’t enjoy them as often”.
