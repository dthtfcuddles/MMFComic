Panel 1: Sher is in a cave whose walls have shiny crystals. He's saying "... and that's what's happening. Horkers are returning here, to claim this planet for themselves, and to get help we need a spokesperson. I am willing to do the job, but I need the elders of most of our tribes to agree with it".

Panel 2 shows Nau and Khi. Khi says "A couple years ago we would have said 'no way', but... when we went to watch your show, we saw how much you grew up. We do believe you and in you".

Panel 3 Nau says "As the elders, our first job is to take the best decisions we can to protect not just this village, but us bunnies in general. When our four eared friends from space came here, we learned that we weren't alone in our goal to survive. We witnessed how things are out there. So yes, Sher, we appoint you as our spokesperson. Do we need to tell anyone in particular?".

D is holding a bunny baby in his arms. The deer says "Don't worry about that, the camera strapped to my antler recorded the entire talk". Sher asks "Why are you holding that baby?".

The last panel shows a closeup of the baby's face, and D says "he he he... well, he's Saye, your little brother. Roi says he hatched from his egg around 3 months ago".
