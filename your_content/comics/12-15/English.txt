Panel 1 shows the Elder of the Tauerk tribe, MMF and the group of bunnies. Rowi says "The party thinks the new place is perfect, but very far away from here... and we can help with that and make the move fast and painless". A bunny says "The cave is great! Nice underground lake and lots of glowy berries", another says "And the area around it has no 'white moss' at all!". The elder says "Well, Sher, Rowi-Friend and Dee-Friend, it looks like you had a good impression on my boys. What do we have to do to move quickly?".

Panel 2 shows the hover car with an attachable trailer behind, traveling at huge speed. Sher says "I didn't know we had a small attachable trailer for this car, I always thought it was just a high tech box when I saw it in the storage room.". Rowi says "Yeah, this is standard equipment for any ships of category 4 and higher. You never know when you'll need to move across a planet's surface and carry large amounts of stuff". A bunny says "Fwooosh! Look mum! This is super fast! Ahhhh!. The narration says "And this is how we helped the tauerk tribe to move. Instead of taking several dangerous weeks, it took us around 16 hours in total to move everyone and everything they had".
