Russet: I had one fan ask me why the adult bunnies are climbing D here.
You have to remember most bunnies do not live to Elder status due to the dangers of the planet.
So the majority of the population are younglings and young adults.
It is part of why Elders are so respected, they have survived to reach Elder status.

htf: At least until now.
