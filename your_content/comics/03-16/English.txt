Panel 1: Rowi says “I think you may be right and the nexus has obsolete info. I didn’t expect some robot species to be inhabiting this planet too. Not that surprising either, I know we Avali want to have all the information we can, but the Universe is way too big to catalog it all”.

Panel 2 Sher says “Oh yeah, I always meant to ask, how big is the universe as a whole? I’m surprised we always find planets with life like us, and we never visit truly exotic places”.

Panel 3 Rowi says “What a great question! To understand it, we must start seeing how minuscule we are regarding everything else. Take Earth, for example, its diameter is around 12750 kilometers. The distance from Earth to sun is around 150 million kilometers.

Panel 4: “Now, this sun and the planets surrounding it are in a galaxy named Milky Way, that in itself is around 52800 light years big. That measure in kilometers or miles is so huge that its impractical. That’s why we use light years. 1 LY is around 9 trillion kilometers (9000000000000), so, the milky way is ~475 quadrillion kilometers big”

Panel 5: “The milky way is part of a group of around 30 galaxies called by humans “Local Group”. That group is part of a massive cluster of galaxies named “The virgo supercluster” that is around 100 million light years in size”. Sher replies with “Huge numbers. I knew the universe is big but had never stopped to think about how big. And this is just a single supercluster”.

Panel 6: “While humans can only see a tiny fraction of the universe (around 92 billion light years, with themselves at the center), that’s just a speck of its total size. This is also why even with warp technology, going from Earth to Avalon would take two weeks. Because the distances are almost incomprehensible”.
