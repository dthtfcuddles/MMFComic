Panel 1: “I followed the instructions given by the forklift. Surprisingly it was easier than I thought; all I had to do was to ask the robots which one was the ship I needed to board, and I got a reply almost right away. The trip to Iraibas Station took another week.”

Panel 2: “When I exited the ship, I saw lots of different aliens. My instincts went crazy; coming from a planet where ignoring a sense would mean death, this was overwhelming.”

Panel 3: “After being paralyzed in a corner for what felt like hours but was probably just only a few minutes, I remembered that Roi told me about this. "You must overcome your senses”. It’s hard but doable". Sher is in a corner saying “AAAHHH AAAAHHH SO MUCH NOISE! SO MANY SMELLS!”.

Panel 4: “And indeed, my instincts were in overdrive mode, but I was able to get up and overcome most of it. It shocked me to see so many aliens… and no one was even paying attention to me. It was, for the lack of a better word, weird”. The panel shows several aliens walking in a space station. One alien is telling another “Let’s watch this movie together”. And other two aliens are talking. “…and he couldn’t find a single process able to isolate the old address used by the software, to create a dump of the RAM content. He was pissed off”, “I’m not surprised. He doesn’t even know how to change the OS runlevel. I’m surprised you lowered yourself to his level just to prove a point”.
