Finally, chapter complete. Slightly shorter (I try to keep the chapters close to 20 pages long), but the story is moving forward.
This chapter, and the next one, are chapters that will be slow, because of some RL reasons, including me moving away sometime in January or February, if things go as I expect. This means that instead of focusing on MMF I am focusing on earning money (commission wise) to save for said move.
If I’m honest, I think chapter 12 will come out sometime around April or May, but like said, everything will depend on how things go. But the comic *will* continue, as we’re finally approaching some very interesting chapters in the timeline.
Finally, as always, I wanna thank all my readers… or actually I should say “our readers” because the comic isnt “mine alone” anymore. xD But yeah, thank you so much for following this <3 If ya have any feedback on it, I’d love to read it.
See you! You’re awesome!
