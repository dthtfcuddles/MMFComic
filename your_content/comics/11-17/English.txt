Panel 1 shows the Iron starting to levitate. The dialogue says "Okay, we're departing. Destination: Babupekkakerok. Estimated arrival time: 7 days, 26 hours" with a small note saying that in Earth hours that's 9 days and 8 hours.

Panel 2 shows the ship leaving Protion. "According to the document from the Illuminate Sawi sent me, I need to get most of the Elders to say on record that they accept me as an official spokesperson for their clan at an interplanetary level".

Panel 3 shows the ship already crossing across the stars. Rowi says "You'll do great, my dear mango pie. I have an idea, what if once all this shit is done... we hold a huge music concert for the bunnies? We would give your species a show like we have never done before". Sher replies "In what universe would I say no to that!? OF COURSE! Ahhh, honey, you always know how to make me feel better and more confident. I love you so much". Then there's the small "to be continued" banner at the bottom right.

There's a final bit under the page saying "Trivia of the day: The Iron is programmed to have a clock that ticks at the same speed as Earth's, meaning each our is 60 minutes long, each minute being 60 seconds long and each second being 1000 milliseconds long. However, the days in the Iron are programmed to be 32 hours long, letting the band have enough time for everything they want to do, from practices to watching movies or playing videogames. 'Noon' happens at the 16th hour"
