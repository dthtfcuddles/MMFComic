Panel 1: Roi says “Mom? Dad? I have something to tell you. I already talked about this with Sher, Rowi, D and meky goo”. Khi says “What is it, dear?”

Panel 2: Roi says (while having her head gently pat by Mekari) “I’m not going to stay at home. I’ll come to get some of my trinkets, but besides that, I’m going to keep traveling through space with my brother’s family. I know you want me home, but ever since I came back a decade ago, I knew I wanted to come back to space… and now I have the chance to do it safely and not alone”.

Panel 3: Nau says “Roi…”, Khi says “Oh honey, I know we won’t be able to stop you. We knew you’d ask us about it. And we know you’ll do it no matter what we reply. We know you have a whole year of experience here, but we still care for your safety. Can… Can you promise us that you’ll do your best to stay safe?”

Panel 4: Roi says, blushing, “I will do my best to stay safe and… and… I know I tend to be a bit ditzy but… I… I won’t… be alone.. and… and… yeah… staying safe… uh”. Mekari talks. “Sir, ma'am, all I’m going to say is that no matter what happens or what Roi does, I promise you that she isn’t going to be alone. As her friend I am going to stay with her and protect her no matter what”. Nau says “M… Mekari, thank you. Please, dear, you’re a good boy too… Can we entrust her to you?” and Mekari says “With my life, if necessary”.
