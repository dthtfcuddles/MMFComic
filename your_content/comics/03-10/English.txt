Panel 1: The ship is running. Rowi says “Okay, cloak turning on in 3… 2… 1…”

Panel 2 shows how suddenly the ship turns invisible

Panels 3 and 4: The ship stops and the pirate vessel continues going. Someone says “Holy shit! It worked”. Rowi says “And this lake of molten electrum is viscuous enough so the waves didn’t betray us. Let’s go! Ship! Set flight in the opposite direction!”.

Panel 5: The ship is escaping the orbit of the planet. The AI says “Leaving planet’s atmosphere. Warp system enabled. It will activate in 270 seconds”.
