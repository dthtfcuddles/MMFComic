Panel 1: The new guy says “Oh, it’s okay, I’m just a big fan of you, guys, you’re so incredibly awesome! You rock, and… what’s the phrase? You’re nifty!”

Panel 2: Someone says “Stop it, Talirubi, fake flattery will get you nowhere with us”. He replies, with a very annoyed expression, “Ah, it’s you”.

Panel 3: Sher is there and says “I don’t care what you’re doing here or what you want to say. Get out. Stay away from my family”.

Panel 4: Talirubi, annoyed and very close to Sher, trying to look more imposing, “Wasn’t enough for you to destroy my dreams? Now you’re trying to publicly humilliate me?”. Sher replies “Stay away, I said. If you get closer, we’ll remove you from here by force”.

Panel 5: Mekari is holding Talirubi like nothing, saying “I’m sorry, sir, but you must go now. You can come back to talk when you’re sober”. Talirubi screams “Gah! Let me go, you overgrown piece of… whatever you are!”. Sher and Roi are both watching.

Panel 6: Rowi asks “What was that, sweetheart? Do you know him?”. Sher replies “Mhm. He’s Talirubi, and we share some history. He is… He was the drummer and owner of this band before you joined it”.
