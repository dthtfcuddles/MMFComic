Panel 1: Sher is at a bus station. “After asking around and following the directions I was given, I ended up at a "Bus terminal”. I had been told that from here I could travel in one of them to a city named Valparaíso".

Panel 2: Sher is boarding a bus with his guitar on his back, looking up. “My first big challenge on Earth was going to be getting used to everything being designed for tall people. Humans are tall! Like, a lot! Everything felt immense”.

Panel 3: It shows just a bus traveling. “My first impression of Earth was a positive one. People were helpful, and everything was going perfectly. Navigating this new world was not difficult, although the higher gravity pull was tiring. Nothing that terrible, but I needed to get used to it. I wondered if the day I returned home I would be super strong and fast compared to everyone else. Anyways, the trip to Valparaíso was quite uneventful. I admit…”

Panel 4: “… that I passed out. I slept the whole trip to Valparaíso. But in my defense… I was exhausted. I hadn’t slept in over a day by then.”

Panel 5: “I still woke up in time to see… one of the most magnificent views ever. It was there that I understood why Roi had fallen in love with this planet… because I fell in love with it too right there”. Sher is staring at a sunset and saying “No way… this is… SO PRETTY! This… this is so… ugh… why am I crying now?”
