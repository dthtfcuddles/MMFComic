Panel 1: "Babupekkakerok, 7 years ago". It shows four bunnies carrying baskets with fruit half hidden by leaves and mushrooms. One says "Okay, this area is almost all cleared out of food. Hey, Fru, are we returning in 12 moon cycles when things have grown up again?". One bunny replies "Exactly. Okay, let's get ready and start walking back home. If we do it now, we'll reach the Virak cave by sunset and be home by noon tomorrow".

Panel 2 shows the bunnies so well hidden by leaves that they're almost invisible. "We started walking home, in silence as we always did, to avoid attracting predators, hidden beneath the bushes and the trees whenever possible".

Panel 3 shows the bunnies entering a cave. "We arrived at the cave on time. We could cover the entrance with a boulder to be safe".

Panel 4 shows just the two moons of the planet on a starry sky with two trees with snow on top. "That night, while we were safe in the cave, we heard noises. We thought maybe it was a predator and that it would leave soon".

Panel 5 shows, next day, the bunnies coming out of the cave. "Time to go. Stay wary, there's still a weird scent around".
