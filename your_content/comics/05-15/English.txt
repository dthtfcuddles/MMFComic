Panel 1: The trio is next to a tree that has a lot of tulip-like flowers. Both Rowi and Sher hold a flower each. Rowi says “You know, honey, I don’t believe in an afterlife or a god or anything of sorts like you do. However, I am of the idea that someone who did good deeds should always be remembered. Wars simply… rob us from that. This is why the answer to the question you made a couple days ago is… no. It isn’t selfish.

Panel 2: Some flowers are being dropped on top of the others. Rowi continues. “The universe is so immense that nobody could change it for good. Yet I am on board with being a force for good. Not just a fun band to be around. What do you think, D?”. D replies with “What do I think? I think that I thought we were already doing that”.

Panel 3: The trio and Xunkiira are together. Sher is holding two of Kiira’s hands and says “Thank you very much for hosting us these couple days. We appreciate it”. Kiira replies with: “No problem, dearie. I wish you the best in your journey. Oh yes…”

Panel 4: Kiira continues “Change the verse ‘and affection came alive’ with ‘and affection here was born’. It fits better, I think”. Sher has a shocked non-amused expression while he replies with “HEY!”.

Panel 5: The band’s spaceship is leaving the small asteroid.
