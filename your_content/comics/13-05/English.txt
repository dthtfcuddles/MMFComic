Panel 1: Ck'akk is staring at the morning sun coming from the horizon. "You're right. I'm getting involved personally in this because thee vampire bunnies are giving us a unique chance to go against Ky√≥urgawabadi without getting our hands dirty in the process. He's been trying to discredit us because he knows we Avali are more powerful than all his armies. He's been acting nice to get good PR, he even started uplifting some random inferior species just to look good. We cannot let him go unchecked. If we do, he can perfectly sway our allies to his side. We cannot afford something like that".

Panel 2 she says "Supporting these bunnies will be excellent for our own PR, over all if Sher is on our side. So, if you have any ideas, sister, I wanna hear them".

Panel 3 shows a tablet screen. "Well, sis, there is away to solve all this, but they need to iron out all the details of their own agreement. They should hire a lawyer for this". Ck'akk replies "You're a lawyer, you could advice them. Let the agreement be fair for everyone, we aren't trying to screw them".

Panel 4 shows Ck'akk and her sister hugging. Ck'akk says "We'll contact Sawi in 3 days. Let's let the Ouakkia pack rest, I'm sure Rowi, Sher and all the bunnies have been super stressed lately, and they earned a proper break. But when we do, I want you to step in and help them to draft a good agreement that's good for them AND for us". She replies "Got it, sis. I'll do my best. You can trust me in that regard. We just need to tell the rest of our pack so they aren't in the dark.
