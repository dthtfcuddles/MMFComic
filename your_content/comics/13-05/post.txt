Russet: Despite everything Ck'akk is looking at the big picture.
No short term political plans here, she is focused on the whole Avali Empire & stopping the Horker Kings and she knows the bunnies are a step toward that goal.
She is a good bird for an Intergalactic Space Leader.
Also remember the ocean is Purple because she is on Avalon

htf: Funny enough, I don't see her as very selfless. In my mind the political play is stronger than it feels. Ck'akk is focused in her enemy (the Horker King) and bunnies are just a step towards that. In my mind, if there was another way, she would take it and leave bunnies behind if it was better that way for the Avali. The fact she calls the species being uplifted by the Horkers "some random inferior species" hints at that- A very slight and subtle display of specie-ism. That been said, she <i>is</i> being good and helpful in spite of her motivations, and that's important.
