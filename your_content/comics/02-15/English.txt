In panel 1 Roi is asleep on Sher’s bed. Rowi asks “What are ya gonna do now, sweet mango shake?” and Sher replies “I’m gonna take the challenge and try to make some music in my native language for our show. We also need to prepare the venue and all that”.

In panel 2 Rowi and Sher are walking through the ship. Rowi says “You’ve never written a song in it, even though you usually have nice lyrics. Why’s that?”. Sher says “Because it’s almost impossibly hard. How to put it? Hmmm disable your translator for a moment”.

In panel 3 Sher says “I’m not singing, this is my normal talking voice”. His normal talking voice having a complete musical notation on top of it. Rowi says “…oh”.

In panel 4 Sher is hugging Rowi’s arm. Rowi says “It sounds really nice! I’d hear it for hours. I’ll start disabling my translator more often. I’m also surprised that this is the first time I hear you speaking in your native language, considering I know you since 13 years ago…”. Sher replies “Well, I never needed to. When we met I was speaking Spanish, then German, then English, then Avali”.

Panel 5 has Rowi interacting with the ship’s control panel. He says “Okay my bag of refined sugar, you can focus on the songs. I’ll move the ship closer and notify D of it”. Sher says “Okies. Where’s D anyways?”.

Panel 6 has D surrounded by a swarm of cuteness (child bunnies). D is reading from a phone “Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit”. One of the bunnies asks “What is a fence, D friend?”.
