Finally, chapter 9 is done along with Sher’s backstory arc. I hope you liked it! Working this chapter was extremely fun, considering its the very first chapter that has actual real life places in it.

The next chapter will start being worked sometime in May and it’ll likely come out in mid/late June or early July, depending on my speed making the pages (since I am working in other stuff along this comic, pages tend to come out slowly).

I want to thank everyone reading this story <3 I appreciate it more than it may look, and comments/feedback are welcome.

Anyways, see you in June or July!
