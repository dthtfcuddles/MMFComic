Russet: AHHHHH I went a bit AHHHHH at this page.
Vic surprised me with this flash back I never expected Seinu to show up int he comic ever! SO this was like wow totally unexpected but also a bit AHHHH

htf: For context. When I decided to invite Russet to co-write the comic with me, he was working in an earlier version of Voyages of the Odyssey, and the story was great and, for me, a great way to deepen some of the lore that couldn't be talked about in the comic without breaking flow. So I did. The thing is, from that moment (Chapter 7) I knew already that Seinu was going to appear in the comic in a way or another. And while the apparition is very minor, all things considered, it's very important in general. Also, he and his pack will appear again in a future chapter.
