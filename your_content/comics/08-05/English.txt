Panel 1: Sher is looking at the stairs marking the entrance of the cave where he lives. He says “A few days later… Roi didn’t come back”.

Panel 2: It shows Sher hugging a bit of fruit. He in the narration continues. “We don’t have a lot of time to mourn our loved ones. The dangers of our planet are many, death is our constant companion. Such is the Vampire Bunny way, and why our connections between each other aren’t very deep. Yet I was going to miss her terribly.

Panel 3: It shows a group of vampire bunnies, with Sher among them, planning. One says "I was looking at the clouds earlier, and I’m almost sure we’ll have ‘Screaming Snow’ tomorrow night”. Another bunny replies “That means that tomorrow we cannot be out after the sunset. We must prioritize speed, then”. Another bunny says “Let’s go at dawn, then, so we’ll be at the foraging place before noon and we’ll be back before the sun sets”. Sher’s narration says “A couple weeks later I joined one of the foraging parties. The group accepted me right away, making use of my strength and my sharp eye to the benefit of everyone.

Panel 4: Shows Sher and another bunny carrying baskets with fruit. He says "In our society, joining a foraging party means you’re finally an adult. I had big hopes that I would reach that milestone with Roi at my side… it didn’t happen”.

Panel 5: “Screaming snow” is the name that Vampire Bunnies gave to blizzards when they happen at the same time as a thunderstorm. The terrifying sounds, paired with the very harsh arctic winds make this weather extremely scary and dangerous for anyone outside. Nobody, not even the bravest bunny, will dare to challenge it.“
