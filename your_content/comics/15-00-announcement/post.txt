Helloooooooo!
First than anything, greetings everyone, old and new readers.

This post is pretty much to announce that MMF is joining <a href="http://www.foxglovecomics.com">Foxglove Comics</a>, a collective of comic creators!

I'll be honest, words tend to fail me when I'm excited, so I'll try to make this short. We (Russet and me) have been part of the Foxglove community for a while now, and it still came as a huge surprise to receive an invitation to join the collective. After accepting it, it has been a lot of work behind curtains to set everything up and make everything look and behave seamlessly.

The first thing old readers may notice is that there's a new website. This site is a *lot* more responsive and faster than Tumblr, doesn't nag you to register if you don't have an account and in general it's much, much more customizable. Moving everything was a huge endeavor.

The second thing is that chapter 15 is still in development. It should be coming mid to late September if everything goes fine.

And finally, there's a MMF music video to celebrate!

Thank you everyone so much for the constant support. We wouldn't be here without you.
I can't say much more, I'm already quite emotional and yeah

Love you all. See you later!
