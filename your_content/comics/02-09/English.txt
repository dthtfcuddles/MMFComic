Panel 1 shows an egg resting in a “nest” made of small carpets and clothes. Sher just screams in shock.

Panel 2: Rowi hugs a tearful Sher, telling him “Calm down, my chocolate bread, I’m here”. Sher says “I can’t! I can’t! This is way too much for my heart!”.

Panel 3 shows the egg from closer, and it says “Vampire bunnies can only lay a single egg every two or three years. While the egg can develop normally between 2°C and 7°C (36°F and 44°F), it requires very particular light conditions for the baby to develop correctly. This is why they are kept only in the glow of the cave’s shiny crystals”.

Panel 4 says “Later…” and shows Sher lying down on his bed.

Panen 5 shows Rowi opening the door of Sher’s room. He asks “Hey, watermelon heart, may I come in?”. Sher replies “Of course, hun. You don’t need to ask me, ever”.
