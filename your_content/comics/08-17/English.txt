Panel 1: “This old couple, Benita and Gonzalo were going back to Earth after visiting their son who worked at a space station. They were from Chile, from a city named ‘Puerto Montt’ that they encouraged me to visit sometime. I told them my story”. Benita says “That 'Roi’ girl sounds like a very interesting person! I hope I can meet her someday!’. The narration continues. "Gonzalo was a lawyer and he told me he had also been a local politician some years prior to all this. Benita was a housewift (although years ago she had been a music teacher). Both explained to me what I should expect and do once I arrived on Earth, in greater detail than what Roi had told me”.

Panel 2: “Honestly, I only came to realize how incredibly lucky I had been years later while thinking about it. What are the odds of befriending a human couple who were not only willing to let you get into Earth with them but also to pay for your brand new ID? I promised them that I’d return them the money and the favor as soon as I could”.

Panel 3: Sher is taking a bath. He says “They taught me what a 'shampoo’ and a 'conditioner’ were, and I finally understood why when Roi returned she had a very pleasant smell on top of her usual scent.”

Panel 4: Both Benita and Sher are singing ’Chiu chiu’ together. Benita is playing Sher’s guitar. The narration says “Benita not only taught me how to tune my guitar, but also taught me chords and some of her music knowledge. She also said she loved my voice. That felt very nice”.

Panel 5: Gonzalo and Sher are at the shuttle diner. Sher says “Hello! I want one carrot cake and one water! Not fizzy, please!”. The narration says “Gonzalo, on the other hand, taught me how to buy food. And while in this shuttle I didn’t have to pay, he taught me how to do it too”.
