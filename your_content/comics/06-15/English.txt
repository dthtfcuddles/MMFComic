Panel 4: Sher is looking outside, his visor being dark to protect his eyes. “Celebrities… are called “stars”. In an universe with thousands of billions of them… Can we make a difference?”

Panel 5: Both Rowi and D look at each other, standing behind Sher. The bunny says “I’m… I’m sorry. I am just letting my mind wander around. I promise I’ll do my best. Let’s go to sleep, tomorrow is our sound test”.
