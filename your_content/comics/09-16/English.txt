Panel 1: Juan and Sher are at a restaurant eating completos. Juan says “Okay, first thing first. You’re the band leader. You have true passion for music. And I’ll be honest… I don’t. That been said, I’m not leaving you alone. I’ll stay with you until you can find a replacement. Do you know of anyone?”. Sher replies “You know what? I know a friend who could fill the position in”.

Panel 2: “And so, I asked Rowi about it. I admit, while I knew he was in another country, it hadn’t sunk in how far away he was.”

Panel 3: 3 days later, Rowi is at a drumkit all sweaty. He says “I’m not used to play stuff this fast, I got tired, but yeah. What do you think?”. Juan says “Dude, you’re not bad at all!” and Sher says “This was way better than I thought, for real”. The narration says “Rowi managed to impress us. He wasn’t an expert, but he wasn’t bad at all. When I asked him to play something, he played the song ”Hatebreeders“ from The Misfits. When I playfully asked him to play something to shw off, he tried playing ”The Heretic Anthem“ from Slipknot… and actually did it very decently.

Panel 4: D tells Rowi "That sounds funny, seeing your current skills”. Rowi, blushing, replies “I mean, we’ve been practicing 8 hours a day for a whole decade since. Improving is just natural”.

Panel 5: “However”, Juan says “Sher, Rowi, I have something to say. I am going to quit the band. I need to focus on my studies. But… I promise that I’m not going to just leave you in the air. I’ll stay with you until you can find a good replacement for me”.
