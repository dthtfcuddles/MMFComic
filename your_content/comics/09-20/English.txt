“Before leaving Earth again, we decided to take D to different famous landmarks. They had told us that they didn’t know many places on their own home planet… and since we had the means to do it, we rectified that problem”.

Panel 1: Paris, France, in front of the Eiffel Tower. Rowi says “Earthlings love their tall towers” and D replies with “Yeah, that’s true”.

Panel 2: Moscow, Russia, at the Red Square. D says “Dude, this is the fanciest looking building I’ve seen in my life”.

Panel 3: Mt. Fuji, Japan. Sher says “Volcanoes scare me. I think about how an earthquake at home could bury us all”.

Panel 4: Easter Island, Chile. Rowi says “I got us a permit to come closer to the statues than other people using my profession as an alien scientist (geologist) investigating Earth, but touching any of them is absolutely forbidden”.
