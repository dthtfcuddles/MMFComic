Panel 1 shows the ship leaving.

Panel 2 shows it from very far away over a starry sky.

Panel 3 shows the trio. Rowi says "As soon as we're safe with the merchant fleet, we'll have a good breakfast". Sher says "According to the screen, we'll get the navigation instruments back in 1 minute and 10 seconds".

Panel 4 shows Roi and Mekari. Roi says "Rowi? D? Brother? Are you okay? Do you need anything? Remember we're here to help you with anything".

Rowi replies in panel 5 with "We don't need anything, but we appreciate you coming and asking. That's what security has to do, after all", while hugging Sher.

The last panel shows D saying "Aaand we got the navigation systems back. Warping away in 60 seconds". Rowi replies "Yes".
