Panel 1 shows Sher saying "Me? A diplomat? O... okay, I admit I had never thought about that. But... I'd need to tell other vampire bunnies about it... and... do we have enough time to do so? Why all that bureaucracy?".

Panel 2 Ck'akk replies with "Oh, believe me, Sher Ouakkia, as the head of the Illuminate, I know well that you just want to help your family. We Avali are all about family, it's in our blood... and being a Diplomat is a marvelous responsibility. Ultimately, it is about being there for your family and your species. I think you can do it. As for your question...".

Panel 3 Ck'akk continues. "Unfortunately I cannot tell you much. But believe me, bureaucracy is there for a reason. As you told us, Horkers are relying on their excellent PR and we don't want to give them any ammo to contest what we're doing. That's all for now. Thank you for contacting us about this. We'll stay in contact".

Panel 4 has J'ask saying "And Sawi, keep up the amazing work you and your pack have been doing. See you later!".

Panel 5 shows Sher and Sawi, Sawi is frowning. Sawi says "Ok, we're done with this. Well done, Cherry. Lights, turn on". Sher says "What's up, sister? You smell upset".

Panel 6 shows Sawi with a concerned expression. "I can't fool your sense of smell, can I? You're right, though. This went way easier than I was expecting. Something is very fishy... and I have my suspicions".
