Panel 1 shows the pack going in a hover vehicle. "One of the biggest shocks for people not used to Avali groups is a very cool ability we have but that I don't see in others: We can talk and listen at the same time. D told me later that they felt overwhelmed when they saw us all speaking at the same time. I admit I hadn't even thought about that until Sher reminded us. We stopped doing it and eventually D got confident enough to start interacting with us".

Panel 2 D says "From the little I've seen, you guys need to cooperate with each other. Even Rowi has issues trying to do things alone, or even keeping secrets from us". Eikomi says "Yes. As kits we learn that packs are the most important; we have to rely on each other, so much that for us is very hard to comprehend the wish of "Being alone" that a lot of aliens have. It's also, in a way, why it wasn't hard to adopt cherry as one of us, even with him not being an Avali himself".

Panel 3 Rowi is using his tablet and saying "We learn to put packs above everything, but our urges to bond are natural and instinctive to us, since always. We usually don't do stuff on our own, and that's alwo why MMF became an extension of my pack. For me you are just... my family. There's no other word to describe it. And everyone here agrees with that view. For all intents and purposes, you are part of this pack".

Panel 4 shows the hover vehicle from above, going full speed. Sher asks "Where are we going, honey?". Rowi says "We're heading to the place where our residential tents are set up. I also sent our spaceship there, it should be waiting for us in that place". Sher asks "How are you feeling, D?". D replies "I... I'm okay, thanks for asking".
