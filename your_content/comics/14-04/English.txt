Panel 1 shows Eikomi and D sitting on the snow. D says "Avali society, from what I saw, has all its focus in packs and family. Human society... it has a focus in family but it can be very fractured too".

Panel 2 shows the two moons. "Since the day I was born, mom made very clear that I wasn't a wanted kid. I grew up being told so. As a kid, I used to stare at the moon, at the stars, wondering if there was anyone in the universe who would tell my mom 'OK, you don't want him, but I do'. Heh."

Panel 3 Eikomi says "Telling someone that they're not wanted is a very asshole thing to do. I can't even begin to imagine saying that to a damn kid!".

Panel 4 D continues "At some point, these words became just noise. But I always hated myself for existing. Small joys like watching anime became my main reason to live".

Panel 5 shows both from farther away. Eikomi says "I remember that time at Warfaisser a couple years ago, your father trying to contact you. What was that about?". D replies "Ah, my dad. He left us when I was 4 or 5 years old. I don't really have good things to say about him".

Panel 6 D says "All I know is that he was having a double life, and he left us because he wanted to go back to his 'real' family; we were just a 'side hustle' for him".
