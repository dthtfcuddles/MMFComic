Panel 1: There are four people and Sher is coming with a tray with beer and glasses. “While I was working there, I learned there were regulars. ‘The band’ would come to have some beers every 3 or 4 days after band practice”.

Panel 2: There’s a teen with an annoyed expression, wearing a hoodie. “There was this guy, Marco, who used to come to the restaurant every 2 or 3 days. He hated being talked to, so our interactions ere only about the food he wanted. He would come with a thick hoodie no matter how warm it was outside, and Mr. Rodriguez also forbid me from charging him, so he ate for free.

Panel 3: It shows an almost bald guy wearing a thin shirt, with a perverted grin, holding a mug of beer. "Mr. Cifuentes used to come every weekend to watch the soccer matches on TV. He said he was going through a divorce and that his wife didn’t know what 'a good steak’ was. He loved to talk to me about 'Santiago Wanderers’, whatever that was.”

Panel 4: Theres a TV showing a presenter asking 'What does that mean for the neighbor who’s scared that a criminal will get into their house knowing they won’t be punished?“. Sher keeps narrating. "We had a TV fixed to the wall. The days there were soccer games we’d air these, and when that was not happening, we would put on the 'TVN’ station. It wasn’t super fun, but that taught me a lot about human society that I didn’t know before.”

Panel 5: It shows Sher sleeping on a chair in the darkness of a basement. “… And I’ll be honest, while today I wouldn’t accept it, back then I thought that sleeping in a rattan chair in the basement was a good deal”.
