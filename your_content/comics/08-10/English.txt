Panel 1: Sher says, still with tears and with an angry expression “I decided to go to Earth like Roi did. I want peace and to enjoy nice things too”.

Panel 2: Nau screams “NO! I FORBID IT! What’s wrong with you!? Are you crazy!?”. Sher says “I’m not crazy! I’m not a youngling anymore! I can do it!”. Nau replies “It’s not about if you can do it! Our lives aren’t just ours! They also belong to the village! Its well-being comes first!”. Khi says more sternly “Do you really want to take away a fully capable adult from your foraging party and the village?”.

Panel 3: Sher is returning to his cave when Roi intercepts him. “Brother? Come with me. I have something very important to share with you”. Sher says “O… Okay, Roi”.

Panel 4: Both bunnies are sitting in Roi’s cave. The narration says “Roi told me everything she knew that could make my trip easier, safer and enjoyable. I learnt so many things! … I was sure I’d have forgotten most of them by the time I needed it”. Roi says “The space out there is different to anything you know. Your very first job will be finding an EPP before the ship departs. If you don’t, you will die as soon as you leave the planet. I also have this. It’s called a ‘translator’”. Sher asks “What’s an EPP? How do I find one?”.
