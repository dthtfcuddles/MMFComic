Roi replies a bit embarrased “I… I guess?”. Sher says “Mom, dad, I won’t be sleeping here; I have my own place at my spaceship, but I want to retrieve a couple things from my old room. is my room still there?”. D meanwhile just drinks whatever kind of tea they were served.

Panel 3: Sher is going down some sort of ladder built under the floor of the room they were in. Khi says “We’ll trust your judgement, son, but this is extremely uncomfortable for us”. Sher replies “I know, mom, dad, but believe me, you’re safe. Perhaps even safer than before”. Rowi says “We can wait here if that’s better, sugar lump. We’re at your pack’s place, ya should follow their rules while we’re here”.

Panel 4: Rowi is examining the stone with a “!” on top of hm. Sher says “Now, just follow me and be carefull. You really don#t want to get lost in here”.
