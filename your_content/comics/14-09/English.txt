Panel 1 shows D and Eikomi outside in the open. D is crouching, they say "My sister was born human, and my mom adored her for that. She couldn't do wrong, ever. She was always right and good".

Panel 2 shows D doing an anime jump.

Panel 3 shows D landing on the ceiling of a dome house, with Eikomi jumping after them. An arrow says "D could do that due to BPE's low gravity".

Panel 4 has D and Eikomi hugging softly. D says "While she gave me a lot of grief as a kid, I don't really hate her. I resent her, but that's about it. I hope she's doing okay". Eikomi asks "Does she know you're a massive rock star that tours across the universe?".

Panel 5 shows them from another angle and D says with a smile "I doubt it, but if she knew she likely would be furious. She never liked the fact I liked rock music like her".

Panel 6 shows the sky. D says "At some point she even started listening to music she didn't like so she could say we didn't share musical tastes". Eikomi says "T... that's not even petty, that's stupid. What the hell is wrong with your Earth family?" and D says "And I haven't even told you about my dad's side, where I have a deer half-sister. I don't really care much; there's like 600 million light years of distance between us, anyways."
