Panel 1 shows Sher talking to a group of bunnies. Sher says "Hi, friends! Your colors... Are you from the Tauerk tribe? Three days away, walking in the direction of the White Moss Valley. One bunny replies "Hello, Sher! Yes! We're from there. We heard what's going on and we believe you. If you're going to our home to tell our elder about this... send her greetings from Kaf, and tell her that we're resting here in your village, that we'll return home in a couple days. If she still doubts, I'll give you my hat. Hand it to her.

Panel 2 shows Rowi and D talking. D says "Sher looks super confident. He's putting to use all he's learned as MMF's singer. Rowi says I'm so proud of my cinnamon churro".

Panel 3 shows the bunny giving his hat to Sher, while Rowi keeps talking. "What he's doing likely feels very natural to him after talking to thousands of aliens on a daily basis and... that confidence is contagious. There's a reason why charismatic people often lead on Earth, after all.

Panel 4 shows Sher back with Rowi and D. Sher says "We need to go visit other villages tomorrow. I wanna go sleep". Rowi says "That's okay. Since the ship now has our position, you can just beam up from the cave entrance".

Panel 5 shows Roi talking to Rowi: "Rowi? I want to invite Meky here to meet my foraging party and maybe even go with them. May I?" Rowi replies "I'd say, introduce him to your party, but going foraging with them, not yet. Let's wait until Sher is done with his quest. We could need you for support".
