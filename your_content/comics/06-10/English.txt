Panel 1: Sher is serious, talking to his sister. “OK, Roi. I need to know, how did you know I was going to be here? What did you use to come? But more important…”

Panel 2: Sher screams “HOW!?”

Panel 3: Shows Sher screaming, and shows Roi sitting at one of the many seats at the station… and next to her Nau and Khi (Sher’s mom and dad, respectively). “How did you convince our parents, who were TERRIFIED of outer space, to come watch us!? What kind of dark magic did you use!?”. Roi replies with “Ohhh fancy, your visor changes color when you talk!”, Nau says “We were invited! Some… something spoke to us inside our head. It was terrifying! Everything is scary!”. Khi says “We weren’t going to come. Roi convinced us, though. Like, ‘You saw him do a small show for us… don’t you want to see him in his element?’. We talked about it, and… well, we’re here”.

Panel 4: Sawi says something to Sher in avali core (”Cherry, do you want me to tell the pack to wait for the new guests?”), and Sher replies in the same language (”Yes, please, thank you sawi”).

Panel 5 shows Roi with an impossibly excited face. “Taktak a waw Sawi? What does that mean? Little brother speaking languages! This is so exciting! We’re truly out of our planet! Squeak!”.
