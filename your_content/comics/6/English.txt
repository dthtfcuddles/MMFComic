Panel 1: It shows the mouse talking to the band, the camera standing behind the band. Rowi is wearing earrings in each of his four ears, each one is a pentacle. The mouse says “So let me see if I got it right. You’re a group of bards who were invited by one of us to play here. Is that it? Gimme your documents and go back to your ship, we’ll tell you when you’re allowed to come out”.

Panel 2: Rowi and Sher look at each other while D keeps the same “arms at the back of their head” attitude.

Panel 3: Rowi and Sher are resting inside of the ship next to a “window” that shows the beach close to them. Rowi is playing with a Nintendo Switch. Sher says “That dude looked very distrustful of us”. Rowi replies with “It happens from time to time. Don’t worry, Avalis and our allies usually get access preference”. The ship AI interrupts with “Attention: Someone’s outside”.

Panel 4 shows Rowi talking with a big creature that’s probably 7 meters (23 feet) tall. The big creature has a small neck, no shoulders but a large waist, thin legs and the “tail” looks like a spiky fan. The creature has large cat-like ears, hair and their whole fur has stripes. The creature says “Uh… hello? Are you that music band that plays in space stations?”. Rowi replied with “Yes, we are. How did you know?”.
