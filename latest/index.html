<p>Chapter is done.</p>

<p>This chapter was extremely challenging to make. Not precisely due to the content- I knew from many chapters ago that this one was going to be dedicated to D- but because I got sick and started this during my worst days, often when I barely had strength to move. Working on this essentially gave me joy and gave me some ground when I felt like I was losing everything, but that also meant making this chapter alone took 3-5 months.</p>

<p>Anyways, Iâ€™m extremely happy with the events of this chapter. The couple that had been in the planning since two years and six months ago is finally official as well. I am very happy because I also managed to create a backstory chapter without using any flashbacks, a challenge I wanted to tackle on for this.</p>

<p>Thanks for enjoying, reading and for your support. See you in a few months!<br />

<p>Russet: it took us awhile to work out how to close this final page.<br />
But this really just struck a chord with us both, Roi outlining how this is all going to change the world and society of bunnies so much.</p>

<p>See you in Chapter 15</p>

<p>htf: Yes!</p>

                        <p>Panel 1 has Mekari asking "Roi? Is everything okay? Your steps are a bit heavier than usual, like when you're upset".</p>

<p>Panel 2 shows Roi climbing on Mekari's head. "I'm not upset, Meky. But... just come with me?".</p>

<p>Panel 3 is a big one, showing some of the newly built homes. Roi is riding on top of Mekari's head. She says "I don't think my brother realizes what an immense moment this is. What he is doing fr our species; I don't think he grasps how important it is. And... while he was creating his career and building his family on Earth, I was here. I took you to our foraging events so you could witness how we live. I lived that for over 15 years. This incoming show will be the point where everyone, every single bunny, will see what we saw a couple years ago at Warfaisser, and there's no going back from that. I'm terrified... but excited". To be continued.</p>
